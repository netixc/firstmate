# fm-control-lib.sh - the ONE executable owner of firstmate's agent lifecycle
# CONTROL-PLANE mechanics.
#
# Data plane vs control plane (captain-approved root architecture, 2026-07-13).
# bin/fm-send.sh is the DATA plane: conversational text for the agent to read,
# always routing-marked for a kind=secondmate target so the reply comes back
# through the status path. That marking is exactly right for a message and
# exactly wrong for a lifecycle command: a marked "/quit" arrives as ordinary
# chat ("[fm-from-firstmate] /quit") that the agent reasons ABOUT instead of
# executing. bin/fm-control.sh is the CONTROL plane: allowlisted lifecycle
# verbs addressed to an exact task id, with the per-harness mechanics owned
# here rather than improvised per harness in agent prose.
#
# This file owns three capability tables plus their pure artifact-path tables
# and nothing else. It has no side effects, runs no backend command, and reads
# no state, so it can be sourced by a test as a pure contract:
#
#   1. Verb allowlist. There is no arbitrary-text and no generic raw-key entry
#      point on the control plane; a caller either names an allowlisted verb or
#      is refused.
#   2. Per-harness control mechanics: which key interrupts a running turn, how
#      many times it must be sent, and which command exits the agent.
#      These are the empirically verified facts previously carried only in the
#      harness-adapters skill's per-adapter tables; that skill now points here
#      so one executable owner holds them.
#   3. Per-backend capability: which named keys a runtime backend can deliver,
#      and whether the backend has a recovery-grade agent-state classifier
#      (bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_agent_state) able to PROVE that an agent
#      stopped. A verb whose postcondition cannot be proven on the recorded
#      backend is refused rather than performed blind.
#
# `resume` is deliberately NOT a verb. Pi and pi-signed have no verified
# pane-resume contract. `relaunch` covers the same need deterministically,
# because the brief on disk - not a harness-private session - is the durable
# instruction.
