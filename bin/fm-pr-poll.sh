# Static watcher program for a validated GitHub pull request poll sidecar.
# It emits exactly one merged line for a merged pull request and stays silent
# otherwise, including on every error, so a failed lookup can never be read as
# a merge. The identity is data in the sidecar and is never interpolated into
# this source: these bytes are identical for every task. GitHub is read through
# gh, so an upstream checkout needs no extra tooling to follow a pull request.
