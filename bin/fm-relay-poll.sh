#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One short-poll of the relay connector for a pending Relay mention.
#
# Inert by default: a HARD no-op (exit 0, no output) unless Relay is configured
# via a non-empty FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN (from the home's .env or the environment).
# The watcher invokes this trusted repository script directly only after
# state/relay-watch.check.sh matches the expected byte-static identity shim.
# Its contract is "output => wake firstmate, silence => keep sleeping", so the
# no-op keeps the watcher behaving exactly as today until a user opts in.
#
# Behavior when Relay is on:
#   HTTP 204 / empty / missing text              -> print nothing, exit 0 (no wake)
#   auth/config errors                           -> print one rate-limited diagnostic
#   a newly offered mention with non-empty text -> stash the full object to
#       state/relay-inbox/<request_id>.json, record the durable per-request reply
#       context to state/relay-context/<request_id>.json (best-effort), atomically
#       claim state/relay-context/<request_id>.offered.json, and print one compact
#       line "relay-mention <request_id>" (which becomes the watcher wake payload)
#   an already offered request_id                -> print nothing, exit 0
#   a new set of unreconciled public-followup terminal results -> print one
#       "public-followup ..." line BEFORE the relay call, so a promised final
#       reply is surfaced through this same wake path
#
# The public-followup line rides here rather than on a new poll of its own: this
# check only exists in a home that opted into the relay, and it is an O(1)
# directory presence test plus a signature compare, with no tasks-axi call and no
# backlog scan. A home with no pending terminal results pays nothing for it.
# The full object is stashed verbatim, so every conversation-context field the
# relay includes is preserved for relay-respond to handle with continuity; the
# Relay section of docs/configuration.md owns that payload's wire contract. The
# durable context record lets a delayed follow-up recover the ORIGINAL
# platform/budget even after this inbox file is drained.
#
# Config (home .env, FM_RELAY_ENV_FILE, or env): FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN (required),
# FM_RELAY_URL (default https://myfirstmate.io). Auth: Authorization: Bearer
# <token>.
