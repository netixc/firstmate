# fm-lint.sh - the single owner of firstmate's shell-lint definition.
#
# Runs ShellCheck over firstmate's tracked shell scripts at ShellCheck's default
# severity (which reports info, warning, and error - the levels CI fails on).
# The lint command, the file set, the config, AND the pinned ShellCheck version
# live here and ONLY here, so the gates cannot drift apart: both invoke this
# script with no arguments.
#   - CI:       .github/workflows/ci.yml installs the version this script prints
#               via `--required-version`, then runs `bin/fm-lint.sh`.
#   - Pre-push: `bin/fm-lint.sh` provisions the pinned build into ignored local
#               state when ShellCheck is absent, so even cached gate commands
#               run the SAME shellcheck as CI. Without a configured lint command,
#               that gate step never ran this deterministic shellcheck, so
#               info-level findings were not surfaced locally before CI rejected
#               them.
#
# Version parity: CI's ShellCheck used to float with the runner image, and
# ShellCheck retired SC2015 in 0.11.0, so an older CI ShellCheck rejected an
# SC2015 that a newer local one no longer emits. This script pins one exact
# version (REQUIRED_SHELLCHECK) and asserts the resolved `shellcheck` matches it,
# so CI and local run the identical rule set. This is not a CI relaxation: it
# adopts one upstream release consistently; the only difference from the old
# floating CI is dropping the upstream-retired, false-positive-prone SC2015.
# No severity downgrade and no blanket exclude of checks - every still-supported
# finding at default severity is enforced.
# The local == CI parity contract is asserted by tests/fm-lint.test.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-lint.sh                    lint the canonical file set (what both gates run)
#   fm-lint.sh <path>...          lint only the given paths with the same config
#                                  (developer convenience; the gates never pass args)
#   fm-lint.sh --required-version print the pinned ShellCheck version and exit
#                                  (CI reads this to install the exact same one)
#
# Exit status is ShellCheck's own on a lint run, so a caller (CI or the gate)
# fails exactly when ShellCheck reports a finding; a version mismatch or a
# missing ShellCheck fails before linting with a distinct message.
