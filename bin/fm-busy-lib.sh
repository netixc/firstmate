# fm-busy-lib.sh - the ONE owner of firstmate's semantic busy-state contract.
#
# Design source: the captain-approved semantic busy-state redesign
# (2026-07-28): each harness adapter reports turn lifecycle through a
# machine-readable semantic source it owns, classification always exposes
# which source produced it, and missing, malformed, stale, unsupported, or
# unverified semantic data is UNKNOWN - never idle. Endpoint death is the only
# process-level override and yields dead, never busy. Child processes, CPU,
# process sleep state, marker mtimes, and the old global UI-regex OR are not
# state signals here; state/<id>.turn-ended files remain wake NOTIFICATIONS
# owned by the watcher, not current-state truth.
#
# Record file: state/<id>.busy-state - exactly one line, atomically replaced
# by bin/fm-busy-event.sh (the only writer):
#
#   v1 gen=<token> seq=<uint> state=<busy|idle|unknown> source=<token> event=<token> ts=<epoch>
#
# Gen sidecar: state/<id>.busy-gen - one token minted when the task's busy
# wiring is armed (fm-spawn, or a documented recovery re-arm). Every event
# must present the current gen; an event or record carrying any other gen is
# a stale incarnation and is rejected (written events) or classified unknown
# (read records). seq is a strictly increasing integer per gen, advanced
# under the writer's lock, so an out-of-order apply can never regress a
# newer record.
#
# Semantic sources written by adapters (fm_busy_sources_for_harness owns the
# per-harness trust table; a record whose source is not trusted for the
# task's recorded harness classifies unknown, so one adapter's writer can
# never classify another adapter):
#   pi-ext           Pi/pi-signed per-task extension (agent_start/agent_settled)
#   codex-hook, codex-appserver  reserved: Codex, gated by
#                    fm_busy_codex_semantic_source
# Firstmate-owned sources accepted for every converted adapter:
#   fm-spawn         the launch-brief turn seeded at spawn
#   fm-recovery      a documented recovery reset after relaunch
# Classifier-only sources (never written into a record):
#   endpoint-gone, herdr-native, missing, malformed, gen-mismatch,
#   source-mismatch, codex-unverified, no-target
#
# Classification (fm_busy_classify): busy | idle | unknown | dead, always
# with the producing source as the second token. Precedence:
#   1. dead endpoint (fm_busy_classify_live only) -> dead endpoint-gone
#   2. a valid, gen-matching, source-trusted record -> its state and source
#   3. no record at all: herdr's native busy verdict is trusted as busy
#      (generation state is sufficient for busy, not for idle), then unknown missing
#   4. malformed, stale, or untrusted records -> unknown, never a fallback
# The delivery guards in bin/fm-composer-lib.sh match rendered footers for
# submit acknowledgement and away-mode supervisor injection only; neither is
# a recorded worker state source.
#
# Codex negotiation (fm_busy_codex_appserver_observable,
# fm_busy_codex_hooks_verified): the approved contract prefers Codex's
# app-server turn lifecycle with capability negotiation, and sanctions its
# stable lifecycle hooks as the intermediate. Neither is usable on the
# installed binary, so Codex classifies unknown codex-unverified rather than
# falling back to idle, and fm-spawn installs no Codex busy wiring.
# docs/verification/supervision.md owns the evidence for both probes.
#
# Sourcing: set -u and set -e safe; no subshell-unfriendly globals.

# codex-cli 0.145.0 verdict (live, 2026-07-28): NOT observable. The v2
# protocol does define the needed turn lifecycle (turn/started plus a
# turn/completed status of completed, interrupted, failed, or inProgress),
# but an interactive TUI worker neither starts nor attaches to the
# app-server daemon, and `codex app-server daemon start` refuses outside the

# NOT verified. Firstmate-written project hooks under <worktree>/.codex/
# never fired in an interactive pane whose directory trust was granted, nor
# under `codex exec`, in either case with --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust,
