  Agent-only reference for Firstmate worker-runtime operations.
  Use before spawning or recovering a worker or secondmate, handling a trust dialog, sending a runtime-specific skill invocation, interrupting or exiting an agent, resuming an exited agent, or verifying Pi behavior.

# harness-adapters

This is the one skill, trigger, and routing owner for Pi-specific Firstmate operations.
Load this router first, then exactly the common reference and one harness reference selected below.
When an action spans rows, load the union once rather than every reference.
Files under `references/` are resources of this skill, not additional catalogued skills.

## Path contract

The skill directory is the directory containing this `SKILL.md`.
Resolve on-demand reference links and relative links to their executable, documentation, or sibling-skill owners against the skill directory, including links named by a nested reference.
Operational paths keep the context named by their owner: `config/` and active-home settings belong to the active Firstmate home, `state/` belongs to that home, and project settings belong to the target project.

## Non-negotiable safety

Never dispatch a worker or secondmate on anything other than plain Pi.
If `config/crew-harness` or `config/secondmate-harness` names another value, report the invalid configuration and stop that dispatch until it is corrected; never select around it.

On `unknown`, report the runtime blocker instead of guessing.
A current captain override beats detection, while a per-task override governs only that dispatch.
For recovery and control, use the exact `harness=` in `state/<id>.meta`; never infer it from a model or provider.

Deliver lifecycle actions only through `../../../bin/fm-control.sh <task-id> interrupt|exit|relaunch`.
Never type an interrupt key or exit command through `fm-send`, where routing-marked lifecycle text becomes chat.
Trust handling is complete only when inspection proves the target started processing its instructions; delivery success alone is not proof.

## Detection

`../../../bin/fm-harness.sh` prints firstmate's own harness from verified environment markers and process ancestry, and owns how they combine.
A Pi marker names the runtime, but exact Pi process ancestry remains the stronger ownership proof because ordinary environment state can be inherited by an unrelated child or multiplexer.
`../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` owns worker marker establishment, while the README owns the plain-Pi primary launch command.
`../../../bin/fm-harness.sh crew` resolves `config/crew-harness`, where absent or `default` means firstmate's own harness.
`../../../bin/fm-harness.sh secondmate` resolves `config/secondmate-harness` -> `config/crew-harness` -> firstmate's own harness.
`../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` re-resolves on every spawn, and an explicit per-spawn argument wins for that spawn.
Unknown runtime markers and command names remain unsupported.

## Operation-to-reference matrix

Every emitted plan appends the selected or recorded harness reference after the named common references.
The `harness-adapter-routing-v1` object is the machine-readable and human-visible selection contract: choose the operation, choose the scenario within it, then append the selected harness reference.
`default` is the normal scenario when no narrower scenario applies.
The `verify` plan audits the retained Pi contract and its live checks.
