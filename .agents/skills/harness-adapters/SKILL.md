# harness-adapters

Use this reference before any harness-specific firstmate operation: spawn, recovery, trust-dialog handling, skill invocation, interrupt, exit, resume, or adapter verification.

Crewmates default to the same harness firstmate is running on unless `config/crew-harness` records an adapter name.
Optional dispatch profiles in `config/crew-dispatch.json` can override that static default for one crewmate or scout dispatch by selecting concrete harness, model, and effort axes at intake.
When a matched rule or default is a profile array, load `quota-array-dispatch` for the completion-aware candidate choice after this skill establishes harness and model/provider facts.
The captain may override that file at session start or later; a per-task instruction such as "run this one on codex" overrides it for that dispatch only.
`default` means mirror firstmate's own harness.

Secondmates have their own harness knob, so a secondmate can run on a different adapter than crewmates.
`config/secondmate-harness` is the harness the primary uses to launch SECONDMATE agents, resolved through the fallback chain `config/secondmate-harness` -> `config/crew-harness` -> firstmate's own.
An absent or `default` `config/secondmate-harness` therefore behaves exactly as the crew harness did before this knob existed (secondmates launched on the crew harness); setting it splits the two.
The [`secondmate-provisioning` skill](../secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md) owns the complete inherited-local-material allowlist and propagation contract.
This skill owns only the harness-relevant consequence: a secondmate's own crewmates use the primary's inherited dispatch profiles and static harness value, while `config/secondmate-harness` is the primary's own setting and is never inherited - secondmates do not spawn secondmates.
Inheritance copies the literal `config/crew-harness` file, so for a secondmate's own crewmates to run on the primary's crewmate harness the captain must set `config/crew-harness` to a concrete adapter name, such as `codex`.
If `config/crew-harness` is unset or `default`, there is no concrete value to inherit, so the secondmate's own crewmates fall back to the secondmate's own/detected harness rather than the primary's effective crewmate harness.
Inheritance also copies the literal `config/crew-dispatch.json` file, so secondmates apply the same best-fit profile rules for their own crewmates.

Each adapter splits into mechanics and knowledge.
The per-task mechanics, including launch command, autonomy flag, and any enabled crewmate turn-end hook, live in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`.
Agent lifecycle mechanics - which key interrupts a turn, how many times it must be sent, whether the composer needs clearing afterwards, which command exits the agent, and which task kinds the adapter can run - are owned by the executable control plane in `bin/fm-control-lib.sh` and delivered by `bin/fm-control.sh <task-id> interrupt|exit|relaunch`.
Never hand-type an interrupt key or exit command through `fm-send`: a routing-marked lifecycle command becomes chat the agent reasons about instead of executing, which is the defect the control plane exists to remove ([`docs/agent-control.md`](../../../docs/agent-control.md)).
The per-adapter `Exit command` and `Interrupt` rows below remain the verification record for those values; the executable owner is what firstmate actually runs, so a newly verified adapter is not reachable by the control plane until its rows land in that owner.
The primary-session "no turn ends blind" guard contract and harness hook installation paths live in `docs/turnend-guard.md`.
The primary-session watcher wake protocols are rendered from `docs/supervision-protocols/` by `bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh`.
The supervision knowledge lives here: busy state, exit command, interrupt, dialogs, resume behavior, skill invocation, and quirks.
Each adapter's `Busy state` row names only which semantic source that harness uses; `bin/fm-busy-lib.sh` owns the contract itself, including verdicts, source attribution, and the verification gates that keep an unverified harness at unknown.

Never dispatch a crewmate or secondmate on an unverified adapter.
If `config/crew-harness` or `config/secondmate-harness` names an unverified adapter, tell the captain under `AGENTS.md` section 9 that the requested worker runtime is not verified yet, use firstmate's own verified runtime for current work, and ask only whether to verify the requested runtime before future use.
Do not pause current work for that future-verification choice, and never launch an unverified adapter.
If the captain asks for a new harness, propose verifying it first: spawn a trivial supervised task using `fm-spawn`'s raw-launch-command escape hatch, confirm every fact empirically, then record the mechanics in `fm-spawn`, its semantic busy source and trust gate in `bin/fm-busy-lib.sh`, any new composer shape, prompt glyph, or idle placeholder in `bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`'s shared screen classifier (the ONE fleet-wide owner of every composer shape and the `empty`/`pending`/`pending-unproven`/`unknown` decision - teaching it there gives every backend the shape in the same commit, and no adapter may carry its own copy), the tmux agent-process liveness classification in `bin/backends/tmux.sh` when the harness can launch a secondmate, and the verified knowledge here.

## Detection

`bin/fm-harness.sh` prints firstmate's own harness, using verified env markers first and then process ancestry.
Within the Pi family, only the exact launch-boundary marker `FM_PI_HARNESS=pi-signed` alongside `PI_CODING_AGENT=true` selects the signed identity; unmarked shared launcher ancestry remains `pi`.
`bin/fm-harness.sh crew` resolves the effective crewmate harness from `config/crew-harness` (absent or `default` -> own).
`bin/fm-harness.sh secondmate` resolves the secondmate-launch harness through the chain `config/secondmate-harness` -> `config/crew-harness` -> own, so an unset `config/secondmate-harness` matches the crew harness.
`bin/fm-spawn.sh` uses `crew` mode for a crewmate/scout launch and `secondmate` mode for a `--secondmate` launch, re-resolving on every spawn so the split is durable across respawns; an explicit per-spawn harness arg overrides either.
On `unknown`, ask the captain instead of guessing.
A captain override always beats detection.
When verifying a new adapter, record its env marker and command name in `bin/fm-harness.sh`.

For stuck recovery, the target window's harness is recorded as `harness=` in `state/<id>.meta`.
Use that value for interrupt, exit, resume, and skill-invocation facts.

## Primary turn-end guard

The primary integrations for `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, and `pi-signed` have empirically validated hook paths for the "no turn ends blind" guard.
`codex` blocks directly through a Stop hook that preserves exit status 2 and stderr from `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
`opencode`, `pi`, and `pi-signed` expose passive lifecycle callbacks and force one bounded follow-up when the shared predicate blocks.
The exact hook files, commands, scoping rules, and fail-open tradeoffs are owned by `docs/turnend-guard.md`.
`docs/verification/supervision.md` "Turn-end guard" owns active validation evidence.
When changing any primary turn-end hook, validate the real harness behavior in a scratch project or throwaway home before trusting it, then update that doc and the relevant concise fact below.

## Primary pre-arm (PreToolUse) seatbelt

The primary integrations for `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, and `pi-signed` also have wired PreToolUse-equivalent hooks that deny a watcher-arm anti-pattern (shell `&`, truncating pipe, bundling, broad `pkill -f fm-watch`) before it runs.
`codex` blocks directly through a PreToolUse hook.
`opencode`, `pi`, and `pi-signed` block by throwing from `tool.execute.before` / returning `{block: true}` from `tool_call`.
The exact hook files, commands, output-shaping quirks, and validation transcripts are owned by `docs/arm-pretool-check.md`.
When changing any watcher-arm PreToolUse hook, validate the real harness behavior in a scratch project before trusting it, then update that doc.
## Primary session start

AGENTS.md section 3 remains the behavioral owner for session start, while tracked native adapters enforce it idempotently at session open through one of two tiers.
Before inspecting or changing session-open behavior, read `docs/sessionstart-nudge.md`, the single owner of tier assignment, per-surface transports, source routing, the runtime bound, and fail-open behavior.
`docs/verification/supervision.md` "Native session-start delivery" owns active dated commands, payloads, and evidence.

## Primary watcher supervision

At session start, `bin/fm-session-start.sh` prints exactly one watcher supervision block for the detected primary harness.
Do not substitute another harness's wait shape when resuming supervision.
Codex uses bounded foreground checkpoints through `bin/fm-watch-checkpoint.sh` because Codex cannot reason while a foreground tool call is running.
OpenCode uses `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-watch-arm.js`, which coordinates with the turn-end guard plugin and wakes the TUI with `client.session.promptAsync`.
Pi and pi-signed use the tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts` plus the tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts`, both project-local extensions the Pi engine auto-discovers once trusted.
When changing any primary watcher adapter, update `docs/supervision-protocols/`, `docs/turnend-guard.md` if a shared idle or turn-end hook changed, and the relevant concise fact below.

## Launch profile axes

`bin/fm-spawn.sh` accepts concrete `--harness`, `--model`, and `--effort` values chosen by firstmate at intake.
Do not make the shell scripts parse or match natural-language dispatch rules.

Effort precedence is an explicit per-task captain instruction first, then any applicable standing dispatch profile or secondmate pin, then the generic fallback below.
Never replace an effort value supplied by either higher-precedence source.
Use the fallback only when neither the captain nor applicable standing configuration specifies effort.
Use `low` for well-understood work with an explicit bounded path and `xhigh` for ambiguous investigation or design.
Choose intermediate levels proportionally as complexity, uncertainty, blast radius, or open-ended reasoning increases.
When a verified adapter lacks `xhigh`, cap the choice at its highest supported non-`max` level rather than omitting the intended effort silently.
Never select `max` from this fallback; use it only when the captain has explicitly expressed that per-task or standing preference.

The supported launch-profile flags below are verified locally; each row records its evidence.

| Harness | Model flag | Effort flag | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| codex | `--model <model>` | `-c 'model_reasoning_effort="<low\|medium\|high\|xhigh>"'` | Verified on codex-cli 0.142.1. The installed binary schema contains `model_reasoning_effort`, the active config uses it, and the bundled model catalog advertises only low/medium/high/xhigh. `max` is omitted. |
| pi / pi-signed | `--model <model>` | `--thinking <low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max>` | Verified 2026-07-27 on Pi and pi-signed 0.82.0. Both expose the same accepted thinking levels and completed the same model-qualified max-thinking smoke. |
| opencode | `--model <provider/model>` | none for firstmate's interactive launch | Verified on opencode 1.17.6. `opencode run` has `--variant`, but firstmate launches the interactive `opencode --prompt` path, which has no verified effort flag. |

The concrete `harness` field owns adapter identity independently of the model provider: `harness=pi` with `model=xai/grok-*` is Pi using xAI.
No script resolves that split for you: establish which credential store a tuple reads from the discovery surfaces below plus `quota-axi auth --json`'s per-provider sources, and show that reasoning rather than inferring it from a harness, model, or source name.

### Model support discovery

Treat model and provider knowledge as current source-of-truth discovery, not as a permanent namespace or provider mapping.
Use the discovery surface in the current authenticated environment because supported and available models can change by version, account, and configuration.

| Harness | Authoritative discovery surface |
|---|---|
| codex | Open the current interactive session's `/model` picker. |
| opencode | Run `opencode models [provider]`, which lists available provider/model identifiers. |
| pi / pi-signed | Run the selected executable as `<executable> --list-models [search]`; Pi's installed `docs/models.md` owns how built-in, extension-registered, and custom provider/model entries reach that list. |

For an unfamiliar harness or model namespace, establish support and provider identity from that harness's authoritative CLI help, model listing, or current documentation rather than guessing from a name or prefix.
A listing that reaches the account and does not contain the model is concrete evidence the model is unsupported: block that candidate and quote the result.
A discovery surface you could not reach establishes nothing; report that as uncertainty rather than turning it into a supported or unsupported verdict.

When a requested effort value is outside the harness-specific accepted set, `fm-spawn` records the requested `effort=` in meta but emits no effort flag for that harness.
This preserves launch success instead of passing a known-bad value.

## no-mistakes skill invocation

Send the validation skill using the target harness's skill invocation form.
Natural language is acceptable if uncertain.

- codex: `$<skill>`, for example `$no-mistakes`; the slash form is not recognized.
- opencode: no separate verified skill invocation beyond normal slash-command behavior; use natural language if the exact skill command is uncertain.
- pi and pi-signed: no separate verified skill invocation beyond normal command behavior; use natural language if the exact skill command is uncertain.

## Submission acknowledgement hazards

A send or key action reporting success is not proof that the intended action happened.
OpenCode can accept and queue an Enter while leaving text visible even though the send returns success.
The adapter must verify the observable postcondition that is specific to its TUI.

## codex (VERIFIED 2026-06-11, codex-cli 0.139.0)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy state | Unknown until a semantic source is live-verified: the app-server turn lifecycle is unreachable for a pane worker, and project lifecycle hooks did not fire for a firstmate-launched worker. |
| Exit command | `/quit` (slash popup needs about 1 second between text and Enter; the shared submit path used by `fm-control` handles it) |
| Interrupt | single Escape |
| Skill invocation | `$<skill>` (e.g. `$no-mistakes`); the slash form is not recognized |

A `$<skill>` invocation opens a `$`-autocomplete (skill) popup, the same hazard as the `/` slash popup: submitting too fast lets the popup swallow the Enter, so the invocation never lands.
`fm-send` handles it the same way it handles `/` - it gives the popup a longer settle (1.2s) between typing and the first Enter, with the target backend's submit retry as the safety net - but the `$` settle is scoped to `harness=codex`, read from the target metadata for exact task ids or legacy `fm-<id>` labels.
That scope matters because, unlike `/`, a leading `$` commonly starts ordinary text (`$5/month`, `$HOME`), so a universal `$` rule would needlessly slow plain steers to opencode/pi; only a codex target receiving a `$...` message gets the popup-settle.
An explicit `session:window` target has no meta, so its harness is unknown and treated as non-codex (the safe fast-path default).
This is why the validation trigger (`$no-mistakes`) to a codex crew now lands on the first Enter instead of biting the popup.

Directory trust dialog on first run per repo root: "Do you trust the contents of this directory?"
Accept with Enter.
The decision persists for the repo, so later worktrees of the same project skip it.

Resume after exit with `codex resume <session-id>`.
The session id is printed on quit.

**Primary-session guard fact (verified 2026-07-08, codex-cli 0.142.1).**
The firstmate PRIMARY's own `.codex/hooks.json` registers a Stop hook that pipes Codex's Stop payload to `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
Codex Stop hooks block on exit 2 and expose `stop_hook_active` for one-block loop safety.
Codex's Stop payload includes `cwd`, but the tracked primary hook does not use it to choose the guard executable.
Verified on 2026-07-08: Codex runs the Stop hook command with process PWD set to the hook-loaded project root, and no `CODEX_PROJECT_DIR`, `CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, or `CODEX_CWD` root variable is set.
The tracked hook anchors to `pwd -P`, verifies that root is firstmate-shaped and hook-bearing, and then invokes `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` with the original payload.
Codex's primary watcher protocol is `bin/fm-watch-checkpoint.sh --seconds "${FM_CODEX_WATCH_CHECKPOINT:-180}"`, not `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`.
The checkpoint is deliberately foreground and bounded so Codex regains control regularly to process user messages and queued wakes.

## opencode (VERIFIED 2026-06-11, v1.15.7-1.17.6; 1.18.4 busy-queue re-verified 2026-07-20)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy state | The Firstmate-owned plugin's semantic `session.status`: `busy` and `retry` are active, `idle` is inactive, latched to the worker's own session. |
| Exit command | `/exit` |
| Interrupt | double Escape; known flaky while a long shell command runs, so use `bin/fm-control.sh <task-id> relaunch` for a wedged pane |

No trust dialog.
Opencode can auto-upgrade itself in the background and the running TUI can exit mid-task, observed live from 1.15.7 to 1.17.3.
If a pane shows the exit banner, relaunch with `--continue` to resume the session.
`--prompt` does not auto-submit alongside `--continue`, so send the next instruction via `fm-send` once the TUI is up.

**Busy-queued Enter (opencode 1.18.4, tmux backend fix, herdr known gap).**
While opencode is mid-turn, the composer accepts Enter as a "send when the turn
ends" keystroke but does not clear the typed text from the composer until the
turn actually finishes.
Without a fix, every `fm-send` to a busy opencode pane exits non-zero on a
false "Enter swallowed", and every daemon escalation that lands while the
primary is mid-turn is treated as wedged.
The shared `fm_tmux_submit_enter_core` (`bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh`) now falls back
to `fm_pane_is_busy` once the Enter-retry budget is spent: a busy pane means
the Enter was accepted and queued (reported as `empty` so the caller does not
re-send), while an idle pane keeps `pending` as a genuine swallow. The herdr
adapter observes the same opencode behavior but needs a separate fix; it is
recorded as a known gap in `docs/herdr-backend.md` rather than patched here,
so the tmux adapter does not paper over a herdr-specific shape.
Regression coverage: `tests/fm-tmux-submit-busy.test.sh` covers the four
scenarios (busy + pending -> `empty`, idle + pending -> `pending`, busy +
cleared -> `empty`, idle + cleared -> `empty`).

**Primary-session guard fact (verified 2026-07-08, OpenCode 1.17.6).**
The firstmate PRIMARY's own `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-turnend-guard.js` listens for `session.idle`.
Throwing from `session.idle` does not block `opencode run`, so the primary adapter treats the event as passive and uses `client.session.promptAsync` to force one follow-up turn when `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` returns 2.
The companion `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-watch-arm.js` owns normal TUI watcher wake supervision and coordinates with the guard plugin before the guard tries a blind-turn follow-up.
The follow-up was verified in the interactive TUI; `opencode run` can exit before displaying a queued follow-up, so the adapter is fail-open in headless mode.

## pi and pi-signed (VERIFIED 2026-07-27)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy state | The Firstmate-owned extension's `agent_start` (busy) and `agent_settled` confirmed by `ctx.isIdle()` (idle), which covers retries, compaction, tool loops, and queued continuations. |
| Exit command | `/quit` |
| Interrupt | single Escape |

Pi has no permission system, so crewmates are always autonomous.
Pi's `packages/coding-agent/docs/settings.md` UI and display section documents `regular` as the `tuiMode` default and `fullscreen` as experimental; fullscreen can bury steers by rewriting scrollback, so Firstmate avoids it when the installed CLI supports the override.
`fm-spawn.sh --help` owns the executable-pinning and version-safe launch mechanics.
`pi-signed` is the signed wrapper identity verified on version 0.82.0 and exposes the same CLI and TUI behavior as Pi.
Firstmate records `pi-signed` without normalization and refuses rather than falling back to `pi` when that wrapper is unavailable.
The observed signed process tree is an exact `pi-signed` wrapper parent with the Pi application as its child, while tmux reports the foreground command as the exact `pi-launcher` name for both selected executables.
The installed plain `pi` command also execs that signed launcher, so `FM_PI_HARNESS=pi-signed` is the authoritative selection marker and shared unmarked ancestry remains `pi`.
Firstmate sets `FM_PI_HARNESS` explicitly for both worker launch identities, and a signed primary uses the README launch command to establish the same boundary.
Keep the brief as one positional argument.
Multiple positional args become separate queued messages; `fm-spawn`'s template already does this correctly.

Project trust dialog can appear on the first pi run in any not-yet-trusted directory, observed even on clean worktrees.
Accept with Enter.
The decision persists per path in `~/.pi/agent/trust.json`, so later spawns in the same worktree slot skip it.

`fm-spawn` keeps the turn-end extension in `state/`, outside the worktree, because project-local extension files make the trust gate strictly worse and pollute the project.
The extension must listen for pi's `turn_end` event, not `agent_end`, so the watcher wakes after each completed turn instead of only when the whole agent run exits.
Pi sets `PI_CODING_AGENT=true` for its children; this is its harness-detection env marker.

**Primary-session guard fact (verified 2026-07-09, Pi 0.80.5).**
The firstmate PRIMARY's own `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts` listens for logical-run `agent_settled`, not per-tool-loop `turn_end`, and uses `pi.sendUserMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp" })` to force one guarded follow-up when `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` returns 2.
Without `deliverAs: "followUp"`, Pi rejects the send while the agent is still processing.
Pi's primary watcher protocol also requires the tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` extension, same trust-once discovery as the turn-end guard.
The model arms through `fm_watch_arm_pi`, never a foreground bash arm; the watcher tool result and clean-exit fallback are owned by `docs/supervision-protocols/pi.md`.
`bin/fm-session-start.sh` reports when the live Pi-family session has not loaded both the turn-end guard and watcher extensions, and points at the selected executable after project trust as the fix, with `-e` as a trust-free fallback.
When a secondmate is launched on Pi or pi-signed, `fm-spawn.sh --secondmate` launches the selected executable with both `-e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts` and `-e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts`, both already present in the secondmate home's git worktree.
