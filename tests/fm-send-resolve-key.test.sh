# fm-send answerer-closes (--resolve-key) behavior.
#
# A captain decision opened by a keyed needs-decision:/blocked: status line
# historically stayed open forever when the answer kicked off work: the worker's
# next line is working [key=<workstream>], never resolved [key=<decision>].
# fm-send's --resolve-key removes that writer-dependency at its source: the
# ANSWERING firstmate closes the decision in this home's own ledger at answer
# time. These tests drive the real fm-send executable over stubbed transports
# and assert closure through the real consumer (fm-wake-drain.sh's OPEN
# DECISIONS section), never through source text:
#   1. An answer send closes the open decision, including the answer-starts-work
#      scenario where the worker never writes a matching resolved line.
#   2. A routine steer without the flag never closes anything, and a working:/
#      done: line still cannot clear a captain decision.
#   3. A key that is not open refuses BEFORE anything is sent (mistype safety).
#   4. A failed or unconfirmed send never closes a key.
#   5. A local secondmate answer is marked+corr'd yet closes the same way, and
#      the closing line carries the plain answer, not marker or corr bytes.
#   6. A remote secondmate answer differs only at the transport layer: the
#      message crosses the stubbed ssh transport while the close is the same
#      local ledger append; a failed transport closes nothing.
#   7. Flag misuse (--key, empty message, explicit backend target) refuses.
