# tests/fm-harness-liveness-drift-live-e2e.test.sh - default-on drift guard proving
# every INSTALLED harness is still classified `alive` by the tmux liveness
# probe (bin/backends/tmux.sh) AND still identified by the harness-detection
# ancestry walk (bin/fm-harness.sh).
#
# Why this file exists: both verdicts depend on how a harness names its own
# process, which is a surface the harness vendor controls and changes without
# notice. A prior release began reporting its version string as its process name
# and became unattributable, which silently degraded supervision. A regression that
# only a real harness release can cause needs a check that runs real harnesses;
# a stubbed agent cannot see it, and neither can a table of names transcribed
# from a previous release.
#
# Detection carries the same exposure for a second reason: a structural ancestor
# now outranks an environment marker (bin/fm-harness.sh owns that boundary), so
# a harness whose process name stops matching no longer merely loses a fast
# path - the walk keeps climbing and can reach a DIFFERENT harness that really
# is further up the tree. This guard is what catches that at the release that
# causes it.
#
# Each harness is launched bare, with no prompt, so this consumes no model
# tokens. The launch uses whatever credentials the harness already has; an
# unauthenticated harness still starts its process, which is all the liveness
# probe reads.
#
# Portable serial CI installs the public Pi package but no credentials, so this
# guard checks that available token-free surface there and runs against every installed
# harness on more capable hosts. The portable counterpart in
# tests/fm-tmux-agent-liveness.test.sh pins the classifier logic in CI. Run this
# guard after any harness upgrade and before trusting refreshed evidence.

  # spawning its native binary as a CHILD is args strength from the pane process
  # and comm strength from below that child - which is where firstmate's own
  # detection actually runs, as a tool subprocess. Probing only the pane would
  # therefore pass on evidence the guarantee does not rest on, and would keep
  # passing if a release stopped spawning the native child at all.
  #
  # The vantage set is the UPWARD path from the deepest foreground descendant, not
  # every descendant in the subtree, because harness_ancestry only ever climbs: a
  # sibling branch is a vantage firstmate's own detection can never occupy.
  # Restricting the deepest descendant to the pane tty's foreground process group
  # keeps a process left running in the background out of the selection as well.
  #
  # The reject-other-harness cross-check below judges COMM-strength vantages only.
  # An args-strength verdict is path-ambiguous by construction: harness_ancestry's
  # bare-interpreter branch matches a harness name anywhere in the script path, so a
  # harness-spawned helper under a harness-named configuration directory can
  # produce an args-strength match without being the agent itself. Such a helper
  # can be the deepest descendant and sit ON this path. That ambiguity is the sole source
  # of the false failure; a comm-strength verdict carries the real process name and
  # cannot be produced that way. The comm-strength REQUIREMENT is unchanged - some
  # vantage on the path must still name the expected harness at comm strength,
  # because detect_own hands an args-strength verdict straight back to a retained
  # foreign marker.
