# Runtime backend verification

Audience: maintainer verification.

Active maintainer evidence for Firstmate's supported runtime backends.
Current product behavior is documented in [`configuration.md`](../configuration.md), [`herdr-backend.md`](../herdr-backend.md), and [`orca-backend.md`](../orca-backend.md).
Herdr is the sole automatic and default backend.
Orca is explicit-only.

## Herdr

The compatibility floor is protocol 14.
The presentation-projection suite's latest active verification uses Herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19 on macOS aarch64, every other section's latest uses Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17 on macOS aarch64, and earlier 0.7.5 protocol-16, 0.7.4, protocol-14, and 0.7.3 evidence is retained where it defines current behavior or fallbacks.
Protocol 17 keeps every protocol-16 feature gate satisfied; the event and workspace-move floors remain 16.

Core read-only probes:

```sh
herdr --version
herdr status --json | jq -c '{client:.client.protocol,server:.server.protocol}'
herdr api schema --json | jq -c '.schemas.subscription_event["$defs"].SubscriptionEventKind.enum'
```

Observed protocol-16 compatibility shapes:

```text
herdr 0.7.5
{"client":17,"server":17}
["pane.output_matched","pane.agent_status_changed","pane.scroll_changed"]
```

The CLI matrix was checked directly:

| Guarantee | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit session routing | `herdr <verb> ... --session <name>` | Reached the named session even while another server was running. |
| Literal send | `herdr pane send-text <pane> <text> --session <name>` | Left text unsubmitted until Enter. |
| Keys | `herdr pane send-keys <pane> enter|escape|ctrl+c --session <name>` | Enter and Escape worked; Ctrl-C interrupted foreground work. |
| Capture | `herdr pane read <pane> --source recent --lines N` | Small N could return empty below viewport height; a 200-line request plus local trim was stable. |
| Native state | `herdr agent get <pane>` | Working and done transitions were visible; native `busy` remains positive activity evidence, while native `idle` cannot close a turn and the adapter's semantic lifecycle decides worker state. |
| Restart | guarded named-session stop then start | Workspace, tab, pane, and labels persisted; the agent process and registration did not. |
| Close | `herdr pane close <pane> --session <name>` | The exact one-pane task tab closed; closing a final tab could remove the workspace. |

All destructive verification used `bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh` with a non-default `fm-lab-` name and a byte-identical default-session tripwire.
No ambient `herdr server stop` command is a supported test operation.

### Prune and respawn

The real label-collision reproduction is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-prune-safety-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: a pre-existing captain-owned workspace with a seed-shaped tab was adopted for routing but its tab was never eligible for prune because the current create call did not return that seed id.

Restart-husk replacement is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-respawn-idem-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: a restored no-agent tab was replaced create-before-close, while a registered live agent caused refusal.

### Launcher workspace placement

Herdr exports its pane identity into every process it manages, checked on 2026-07-30 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17 inside a guarded lab pane:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh
"$HERDR_LAB_HELPER" run "$LAB" pane run "$PANE" "sh -c 'env | grep ^HERDR | sort > /tmp/env.txt'"
```

```text
HERDR_ENV=1
HERDR_PANE_ID=w1:p1
HERDR_SESSION=fm-lab-fm-herdr-env-pro-65961-25535
HERDR_SOCKET_PATH=/Users/kunchen/.config/herdr/sessions/fm-lab-fm-herdr-env-pro-65961-25535/herdr.sock
HERDR_TAB_ID=w1:t1
HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID=w1
```

This complete injection shape is verified only for Herdr 0.7.5.
Firstmate requires both `HERDR_PANE_ID` and `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` before accepting claimed launcher ancestry.

`pane get` reports the pane's current owning tab and workspace, which is what placement resolves from; the injected `HERDR_TAB_ID` and `HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID` are creation-time snapshots and are not read as current identity:

```sh
"$HERDR_LAB_HELPER" run "$LAB" pane get w1:p1 | jq -c '.result.pane | {pane_id,tab_id,workspace_id}'
```

```text
{"pane_id":"w1:p1","tab_id":"w1:t1","workspace_id":"w1"}
```

Placement is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-launcher-workspace-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees on 2026-07-30 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17:

```text
ok - real herdr E2E: with one 'firstmate' workspace and no herdr parent, a crewmate still lands in this home's own workspace without stealing focus
ok - real herdr E2E: the normal unique-label path is unchanged when the launcher's own pane identifies the workspace
ok - real herdr E2E: presentation spaces still create the isolated child workspace and bind it under the launcher's exact parent, without stealing focus
ok - real herdr E2E: with two 'firstmate' workspaces, a worker spawned from inside the second one lands in that exact workspace
ok - real herdr E2E: the duplicate-labeled sibling workspace is left entirely untouched and focus is preserved
ok - real herdr E2E: with a duplicated home label, a projected worker still hangs off the launcher's exact workspace and the sibling stays untouched
ok - real herdr E2E: an ambiguous home label with no launcher identity refuses before any worker endpoint exists
ok - real herdr E2E: a launcher pane that no longer exists refuses before any worker endpoint exists
ok - real herdr E2E: a secondmate launching its own worker gets the same exact-workspace guarantee, and its same-labeled sibling is untouched
ok - real herdr E2E: a --secondmate launch still stands up that secondmate's own workspace instead of inheriting the launcher's
ok - real herdr E2E: teardown closes only the worker's own pane and leaves the launcher, its workspace, and the same-labeled sibling intact
```

That suite's headline case runs `bin/fm-spawn.sh` inside a real Herdr pane, so the parent identity comes from Herdr's own injection rather than a composed environment.
Cross-session and contradictory bindings are covered deterministically in `tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh`, which can script a second server's socket without provisioning one.

### Per-home and presentation topology

Per-home behavior is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-workspace-per-home-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: the primary and secondmate used distinct home workspaces, a child launched by the secondmate stayed in that secondmate workspace, list-live remained home-scoped, and exact cleanup did not affect sibling homes.

The complete projection suite ran on 2026-07-21 against Herdr 0.7.4 protocol 16:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees included:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: primary and two secondmate homes each own a top-level contiguous child block
ok - real Herdr lab: concurrent primary/A/B spawns stay session-locked with zero focus drift
ok - real Herdr lab: session lock contention from a secondmate home falls back flat with no journal
ok - real Herdr lab: legacy projection labels and flat secondmate tabs are left unmigrated
ok - real Herdr lab: multi-home exact-pane teardowns restore captain focus without workspace close authority
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.4 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

The suite also covers lost or failed move responses, active-tab refusal, restart husks, missing and duplicate tokens, manual renames, concurrent cleanup, and exact focus restoration.

The mandatory projection suite ran again on 2026-07-24 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 16:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed restart-reclaim guarantees:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: Hi Bit and Wheelhouse-style same-identity restarts reclaim one nested space with exact focus and idempotence
ok - real Herdr lab: secondmate restart binding and reclaim stay isolated to the exact child home and parent
ok - real Herdr lab: concurrent cross-home recoveries replace exact husks under one session lock with no focus drift
ok - real Herdr lab: missing, renamed, and duplicate tokens trigger zero destructive or adoptive calls, and live duplicate risk refuses launch
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.5 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

The projection suite ran again on 2026-08-04 against Herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19 for the default-on flip, where an absent `config/herdr-presentation-spaces` enables the projection and only the value `off` opts out:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed default and opt-out guarantees:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: an opted-out spawn retains the Stage 1 Herdr command sequence with zero ordering calls
ok - real Herdr lab: a home that configured nothing is projected by default
ok - real Herdr lab: the primary presentation setting inherits into real secondmate homes
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.8.0 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

The projected spawn in that run used the historical empty opt-in file, so a home that had already enabled the projection keeps it without any migration step.
One concurrent cross-home recovery case refused under contention on a loaded machine and passed on an immediate rerun; recovery-path presentation lock contention is a deliberate hard refusal rather than a flat fallback, which default-on now makes reachable from any Herdr home.

The restored-shell session-start cleanup ran on 2026-07-24 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-herdr-session-cleanup-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: one exact home-local, journal-correlated, one-tab and one-pane childless idle shell was closed after restoration while the exact non-target focus and default fleet session remained unchanged, and a repeat run was a no-op.

### Workspace-removal focus safety

The focus-flash regression ran on 2026-07-28 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17 on macOS aarch64:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-focus-flash-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - old path: the explicit last-pane close of a non-focused workspace stole focus (w3	w3:t1 -> w2	w2:t1)
ok - mitigation: every in-operation sample preserved exact focus while the doomed workspace was removed
ok - mitigation: no explicit close and no corrective focus were needed on the defective release
evidence: herdr=0.7.5 protocol=17 steal_live=1 default-session-tripwire=armed
```

Direct lab probes on the same day established the removal rules the emptying-close plan relies on, each verified with `workspace list` focus reads around one mutation in a guarded `fm-lab-` session:

- An explicit `pane close` that emptied a non-focused workspace moved focus off the focused workspace in both before-focus and after-focus geometries.
- Ending a workspace's lone shell preserved the focused workspace exactly when the dying workspace sat behind it or the focused workspace was last, and moved focus to the focused workspace's right neighbor otherwise.
- The production focus-preserving close in the dangerous geometry repositioned the doomed workspace, ended its proved shell, and left every concurrent focus sample on the exact anchor with no corrective `tab focus` issued.

Two real-hardware conditions were required for the pane-death path to engage and are now encoded in the adapter and its unit fixtures: BSD `ps` reports a login shell's `comm` as `-zsh`, and an idle shell transiently hosts a prompt helper (starship) as a second foreground process immediately after a `workspace.move` relayout, which the bounded settle window absorbs.

The rules match the v0.7.5 tag source (`close_selected_workspace` reassigns focus from the closing workspace's index; `handle_pane_died` only clamps the stale focused index), and the upstream default branch resolves both paths by workspace id (PR #1877, commit `165dca45`, for the explicit close; PR #1912, commit `a979916`, for pane death), so the plan degrades to a harmless reorder-then-remove once a release carries them.

The full projection and restored-shell suites were re-run the same day on the same version with the updated close path; the presentation suite completed with `real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.5 with the default-session tripwire intact`, and the restored-shell cleanup guarantee above was unchanged.

The teardown-level record-retention gate was verified on 2026-07-28 with metadata fixtures and a live contending lock holder:

```sh
tests/fm-teardown.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees: a contended presentation lock refused the teardown before the isolated copy was returned, with the task branch, every durable record, and the endpoint intact and no pane close attempted; the retry after the contention cleared returned the copy, closed the pane under the lock, and removed the records; an unknown structured-presence result after an attempted projected close retained the journal and every record with a nonzero exit; and every presence-gate mode accepted only a structured not-found as gone.

The same fixtures verified three further boundaries on 2026-07-29: missing or malformed endpoint identity and an unparseable pane presence refused record removal with everything retained; the SIGKILL escalation re-read the exact pane's process information and refused to signal when a different shell pid owned the pane, falling back to the plain close with the original process untouched; and a reposition whose removal then failed on every path restored the exact original workspace order through a second verified move and reported the close as failed.

The teardown fixture was re-run on 2026-07-31 after extending the same fail-closed boundary through forced secondmate cleanup, including recursive cleanup of a nested secondmate whose Herdr grandchild close remains unconfirmed.

Observed output:

```text
ok - forced secondmate teardown preflights every Herdr child before cleanup mutation
ok - forced secondmate teardown retains Herdr child identity until exact pane disappearance
ok - forced teardown retains a nested secondmate home and its grandchild's Herdr identity when the grandchild close is unconfirmed
```

### Composer and operational input

Real captures verified these active distinctions:

- Claude and Codex use bare `❯` and `›` agent composers.
- Pi uses content between complete separator rows and requires exact native Pi identity.
- Dim or faint suggestion text is ghost content, while normally styled text is pending input.
- Grok dark truecolor placeholders are ghost content, while bright truecolor typed input remains pending.
- A bare shell prompt has no safe agent-composer container and is unknown.

`tests/fm-composer-ghost.test.sh`, `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh`, and the Herdr composer cases pin the exact captured ANSI bytes.
The U+2063 operational and routed-request separators were exercised through a real Pi-on-Herdr path; the byte-exact active regression is:

```sh
FM_SEND_MARKER_HERDR_E2E=1 \
  tests/fm-send-secondmate-marker-herdr-e2e.test.sh
```

### Native blocked event

The protocol-16 event path was measured on 2026-07-11 with Herdr 0.7.3 and Python 3.13:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-eventwait-smoke.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - real herdr: events.subscribe capability gate passes
ok - real herdr: a driven idle->blocked transition returns the blocked record in 0.129s
ok - real herdr: the watcher fast-path enqueues a stale wake naming the task window
```

Polling remained active and is covered as the fallback for capability, connect, subscribe, and repeated reader failure.

### Away-mode transport

The Pi/Herdr return and injection path was reverified on Herdr 0.7.3 and Pi 0.80.7:

```sh
FM_AFK_PI_HERDR_E2E=1 HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-afk-pi-herdr-return-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees: pending composer input refused injection and raised one alert; idle Pi accepted one marked escalation; the return gate refused ordinary work while a live blocker remained; resolving the blocker allowed the return flow.
The dedicated Herdr daemon workspace topology is covered by `tests/fm-afk-launch.test.sh` and preserves the captain tab's pane count.

## Orca

Real readiness was verified against `/usr/local/bin/orca` with `/Applications/Orca.app` bundle version 1.4.116.

```sh
orca status --json
```

Observed fields:

```text
result.runtime.reachable=true
result.runtime.state=ready
```

`orca terminal create --json` returned `result.terminal.handle`.
`orca worktree create` returned `result.worktree.id` and `result.worktree.path`.
Speculative bare ids and nested terminal fields were deliberately rejected.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-orca.test.sh
tests/fm-backend.test.sh
tests/fm-bootstrap.test.sh
```

The fake-Orca suite covers readiness, registration, create response parsing, metadata routing, popup-safe submit, and path-matched release refusal.

## Codex App host tools

A reusable Desktop host-tool smoke ran on 2026-07-06 against Codex Desktop bundle version 26.623.101652, build 4674, bundle id `com.openai.codex`.
Local paths and task-specific ids are intentionally not retained here.

The host-tool sequence was:

1. list a saved project;
2. create a Desktop-owned worktree thread;
3. recover and read the thread while active and after completion;
4. verify the thread appended a Firstmate status line and wrote its report;
5. send a follow-up to the same thread;
6. read the completed follow-up;
7. archive the exact thread;
8. read the archived transcript with state `notLoaded`.

Observed guarantee: a Desktop-owned thread can write Firstmate lifecycle files when the prompt provides an authorized absolute path, and create, send, read, and archive work at the Desktop host-tool layer.
The missing guarantee remains a supported shell-callable bridge that lets Firstmate perform those operations against the same visible Desktop endpoint.
App-server partial methods and raw socket experiments do not satisfy that bridge contract.
