# Supervision integration verification

Audience: maintainer verification.

This record supports current session-start, turn-end, and watcher-continuity guarantees.
Operator behavior and active limits remain in the linked current guides.
Task-specific chronology, temporary paths, run identifiers, and delivery transcripts remain in private reports or PR evidence.

## Native session-start delivery

The native transport pass ran on 2026-07-17 with Pi 0.80.10.

Pi command shape:

```sh
pi -p -e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts \
  --no-context-files --no-session \
  'After obeying any earlier session-start instruction, reply with exactly PI_SMOKE_DONE.'
```

Observed result: `PI_SMOKE_DONE`, with one session-start execution.
That cold positional-prompt check established eventual custom-message delivery, but it did not submit immediately after `/new` while native digest generation was still running, so its earlier race-free inference is superseded by the provider-prerequisite evidence below.
[`runtime-backends.md`](runtime-backends.md#plain-pi-runtime-identity) owns the authoritative plain-Pi identity boundary.

### Run-tier source vocabulary and context-reset injection

The run tier depends on three facts only the vendor can supply: the session-open source it reports, whether hook stdout reaches model context on a context-RESET open rather than only a cold one, and whether a worker the hook detaches survives the hook returning.
The first two were measured on 2026-08-05 against a throwaway Firstmate-shaped lab carrying Pi's tracked registration with a recorder standing in for `bin/fm-sessionstart-run.sh`.
Each open printed a source-stamped token, and the model was asked to quote that token back, so producing hook stdout could never be mistaken for delivering it.
The third is recorded below.

| Harness | Version verified | Cold open | Context reset | Context-preserving reopen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pi | 0.82.0 | `source=startup`, token quoted back in both `-p` and the TUI | `/new` raises `session_start` reason `new`, which the extension maps to `clear`; `/compact` raises `session_compact`, and both freshly injected source-stamped tokens were quoted back | `pi -c` reports reason `startup`, not `resume` |

Pi compaction was verified on 2026-08-05 with Pi 0.82.0 in the same throwaway lab after setting `.pi/settings.json` `compaction.keepRecentTokens` to 200 and completing one substantial assistant-prose turn before issuing `/compact`.
Pi reported `Compacted from 7,697 tokens`, the recorder observed `session_compact`, and the model quoted the freshly injected `source=compact` token back.
Both preconditions are load-bearing: the stock 20,000-token keep window exceeds a small lab session, and `AgentSession.compact()` aborts an in-flight turn before measuring compactable history, which otherwise discards that turn and reports `Nothing to compact (session too small)`.
Tool output alone does not grow compactable context; the completed assistant prose does.

Observed compaction output and recorder source:

```text
Compacted from 7,697 tokens
compact
```

A new Pi process continuing a session reports `startup`, while Pi's `resume` reason is reserved for an in-process session switch.
Pi's current transport and baseline mechanics are owned by [`../sessionstart-nudge.md`](../sessionstart-nudge.md#pi-transport) and the `bin/fm-session-start.sh` header.
Their continuation classification is covered by portable tests, not claimed as live validation in this record.

### Pi `/new` provider prerequisite

The real offline Pi regression ran on 2026-08-26 with Pi 0.84.0, an isolated home and session directory, a barrier-controlled native digest, and a deterministic local `streamSimple` provider.
The provider makes no HTTP request and requires no user credential.
Its missing-native branch deliberately requests `bin/fm-session-start.sh`, so an escaped first call reproduces the duplicate-producing manual path rather than passing vacuously.

```sh
FM_PI_SESSIONSTART_RACE_LIVE_E2E=1 \
  tests/fm-sessionstart-hook-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - Pi 0.84.0: immediate and completed-before-prompt /new paths each made one first provider call with exactly one native startup context and no manual execution
# fm-sessionstart-hook-live-e2e.test.sh: offline Pi /new race assertions passed
```

The immediate case submitted its first prompt only after the native `clear` child published `started`, held the child behind a release barrier, and proved the provider log remained absent for 500 milliseconds before release.
After release, the first payload reported one native context and no manual result, the session persisted one matching custom message, and the fixture recorded one native execution.
The control case let native generation complete before prompt submission and produced the same first-payload result.
The portable public-event regression in `tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh` separately covers interruption, process-tree retirement, two rapid replacements, stale completion, empty output, spawn error, timeout output, truncation, ineligible stand-down, and compaction cancellation.

### Post-start instruction refresh

The isolated real-Pi instruction-refresh regression ran on 2026-08-11 with Pi 0.84.0.
It used a scratch `FM_HOME`, a private tmux socket, and a disposable Firstmate checkout.
The historical `origin/main` implementation first reproduced the stale original marker after a real compaction.
The current implementation then recorded `source=startup`, changed and committed the lab's `AGENTS.md`, compacted the same real Pi session, and answered with the replacement marker.
The fixed run also proved that the true-start baseline remained different from the updated file after compaction.

```sh
FM_SESSIONSTART_INSTRUCTION_REFRESH_LIVE_E2E=1 \
FM_SESSIONSTART_INSTRUCTION_REFRESH_REF=origin/main \
FM_SESSIONSTART_INSTRUCTION_REFRESH_EXPECT=stale \
tests/fm-sessionstart-instruction-refresh-live-e2e.test.sh
# ok - Pi 0.84.0 reproduces stale AGENTS.md after a real compact

FM_SESSIONSTART_INSTRUCTION_REFRESH_LIVE_E2E=1 \
tests/fm-sessionstart-instruction-refresh-live-e2e.test.sh
# ok - Pi 0.84.0 re-injects updated AGENTS.md after a real compact in an isolated session
```

This is live coverage only for Pi compaction.
The portable session-start tests cover continuation classification, baseline immutability, and source-routing behavior.
Pi compaction is the only supported stale-cache refresh pair.

## Semantic busy state

The per-adapter semantic sources behind [`bin/fm-busy-lib.sh`](../../bin/fm-busy-lib.sh) were live-verified on 2026-07-28 against firstmate-launched workers wired exactly as `fm-spawn` writes them.
Each pass polled `state/<id>.busy-state` while a real turn ran.

| Harness | Version verified | Semantic source | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pi | 0.82.0 | Extension `agent_start` / `agent_settled` with `ctx.isIdle()` | The spawn seed `busy source=fm-spawn`, then `busy source=pi-ext event=agent-start`, then `idle source=pi-ext event=agent-settled`; the turn-end marker was still touched. |
Deterministic entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-busy-state.test.sh
tests/fm-busy-adapter-wiring.test.sh
tests/fm-crew-state.test.sh
```

## Turn-end guard

The bounded follow-up mechanism was validated on Pi across 2026-07-08 through 2026-09-05.

| Harness | Version verified | Mechanism | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pi | 0.80.5 | Passive `agent_settled` callback | Exactly one guard follow-up ran for an unhealthy cycle, with no recursion across tool turns. |
Session-lock ownership in `bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh` is decided against a session's whole contiguous recognized-runtime ancestry rather than one chosen pid.
`tests/fm-session-lock-ancestry.test.sh` pins the supported runtime reporting semantics behind a deterministic process table.
`tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` runs real watcher and arm cycles against durable on-disk state to verify that a delivered reason survives until post-handling acknowledgement and stops replaying after acknowledgement, while an unrelated queue append cannot make a watcher cycle that delivered nothing look successful.
The same suite ingests a keyed remote-secondmate parent reply through the real adapter, establishes the incremental OPEN DECISIONS cursor, interrupts supervision, and proves re-arm replays every unacknowledged queue row plus the still-open decision through the ordinary drain path.
It also covers decision-only recovery, interrupted handling, handling-window generation reuse, non-fatal moved-generation acknowledgement with sequence-bounded consumption, and a persistent successor remaining live after recovery is acknowledged.

Current entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh
tests/fm-supervision-instructions.test.sh
FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
```

The Pi extension-model pull-guard correction (`bin/fm-guard.sh` no longer reports a false watcher-down on a Pi primary during the extension's own watcher hand-off) was verified on 2026-08-13 with the installed ShellCheck 0.11.0 and isolated behavior suites.
The guard verdict itself reads only state files and process liveness, so the portable suites are the enforcing evidence; `bin/fm-harness.sh`'s Pi marker detection, which selects the model, is exercised in the same suite through `PI_CODING_AGENT`.

```sh
bin/fm-lint.sh
bin/fm-doc-audience-check.sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-guard-stale-banner.test.sh tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh tests/fm-session-start.test.sh tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
fm-lint.sh: ShellCheck 0.11.0 (pinned 0.11.0)
fm-doc-audience-check: ok surfaces=67 local_links=243
FM_TEST_SUMMARY total=5 failed=0 skipped_gate=0 duration_ms=280160
```

The same correction was verified against a live Pi primary's own supervision evidence on 2026-08-13.
The hand-off was captured live at beacon age 63s, then the home's `state/.lock`, `state/.last-watcher-beat`, both `state/.pi-*-extension-loaded` markers, and both `.pi/extensions/*.ts` builds were copied into an isolated fixture with no watcher lock.
The fixture's copied beacon was fresh at 0s in the output below; the deterministic stale-beacon case separately verifies the grace boundary.

```sh
FM_SUPERVISION_MODEL=persistent FM_GUARD_READ_ONLY=1 bin/fm-guard.sh
FM_SUPERVISION_MODEL=extension FM_GUARD_READ_ONLY=1 bin/fm-guard.sh
```

Observed output, before and after the model correction, then with the recorded Pi session pid replaced by a dead one:

```text
●  WATCHER DOWN - SUPERVISION IS OFF
●  1 task(s) in flight, but no live watcher process holds this home lock (last beat: 0s ago).
(silent)
●  WATCHER DOWN - SUPERVISION IS OFF
●  1 task(s) in flight, but no live watcher process holds this home lock (last beat: 0s ago).
```

The broader relevant regression pass was rerun on 2026-08-02 without touching a live home.

```sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh tests/fm-afk-launch.test.sh tests/fm-afk-return.test.sh tests/fm-x-mode.test.sh tests/fm-backend.test.sh tests/fm-backend-tmux-smoke.test.sh tests/fm-secondmate-safety.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
FM_TEST_SUMMARY total=8 failed=0 skipped_gate=0 duration_ms=617507
```

## Watcher continuity

The live evidence uses isolated project and home state and copies no credential material into fixtures.

| Runtime | Exact opt-in command | Observed guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pi | `FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | One initial tool call led to extension-owned successors and clean child retirement on exit. |

Pi 0.81.1 repeated the continuity and clean-exit lifecycle on 2026-07-23 after the Calm presentation changes.

Pi same-process session-transition ownership was verified on 2026-09-01 against the tracked extension with provider-free public lifecycle events, retained and fresh extension-module rebinds, and real arm children:

```sh
pi --version
tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh
tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: after ordinary `session_shutdown` for `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, and reload, plus same-instance shutdown-plus-start, an owning `session_start` armed the replacement generation before any model turn and without the `watcher: not armed - Pi session is shutting down` refusal.
A fresh module rebind also received exactly once the actionable close whose first delivery was still in flight at shutdown, while retaining one live successor.
Stale prior-generation tool callbacks could not mutate the active child, repeated transitions kept exactly one live arm cycle, and terminal `quit` still refused late rearm.
The strict no-emit check used the installed Pi SDK declarations to hold the lifecycle event contract.
Plain Pi uses the tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` generation owner.

On 2026-09-02 the same suite, the strict typecheck, and the credential-free real-SDK guard were rerun against `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.84.4 after the extension stopped waiting for `before_agent_start` before settling a main delivery; [`runtime-backends.md`](runtime-backends.md#2026-09-02-streaming-time-watcher-delivery) owns the exact commands and output.
Observed guarantee: a wake delivered while main was streaming was followed by a verified successor and by delivery of the next actionable close, a replacement replayed only the follow-up Pi had not consumed, an exhausted restoration delivered its typed failure without launching an arm past the retry bound, and a verified successor that failed while a branch settlement still held its wake took the ordinary bounded retry once that delivery settled.

The once-per-generation recovery bound and immediate handling-successor poll were verified on 2026-08-21 with the tracked Pi extension, real watcher processes, and an isolated home.
The regression forced handling confirmation to fail, observed one recovery follow-up across the former repeat window, confirmed the successor remained live, and then proved a separate handling successor durably queued a crew event within the bounded poll window.

```sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-watch-recovery-loop.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - a resurfacing handling successor stays alive and supervises instead of going blind
ok - unacknowledged recovery is announced at most once per generation and the successor stays alive
FM_TEST_SUMMARY total=1 failed=0 skipped_gate=0 duration_ms=59357
```
