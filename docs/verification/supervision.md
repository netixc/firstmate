## Native session-start delivery

The cross-harness transport pass ran on 2026-07-17 with Codex 0.144.4, Grok 0.2.103, OpenCode 1.17.18, and Pi 0.80.10.

Codex command shape:

```sh
codex exec --ephemeral --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --output-last-message last.txt \
  'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.'
```

Observed result: the `SessionStart` hook completed and its stdout reached model context.

Grok command shape:

```sh
grok --trust -p 'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.' \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format plain
```

Observed result: the project hook ran, but its stdout did not reach model context.
This is the current Grok fail-open limit.

OpenCode was checked in both headless and interactive modes.
`client.session.promptAsync` accepted the nudge in both cases; the persistent TUI completed the generated turn, while `opencode run` exited before another turn.
This is the current headless fail-open limit.

Pi command shape:

```sh
pi -p -e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts \
  --no-context-files --no-session \
  'After obeying any earlier session-start instruction, reply with exactly PI_SMOKE_DONE.'
```

Observed result: `PI_SMOKE_DONE`, with one session-start execution.
That cold positional-prompt check established eventual custom-message delivery, but it did not submit immediately after `/new` while native digest generation was still running, so its earlier race-free inference is superseded by the provider-prerequisite evidence below.
The installed pi-signed 0.82.0 wrapper repeated the shared Pi primary extension and session-start path on 2026-07-27.
[`runtime-backends.md`](runtime-backends.md#tmux) owns the shared-ancestry evidence and authoritative selection-marker boundary.

### omp (Oh My Pi) native delivery, 2026-09-05

The omp Run-tier adapter was verified on 2026-09-05 with omp 18.1.11 and the openai-codex `gpt-6-astra` model through `FM_OMP_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-omp-primary-live-e2e.test.sh`, which drives a real omp in its JSON-RPC stdio mode inside an isolated lab clone.
Both tracked `.omp/extensions/*.ts` files loaded by auto-discovery alone (no `-e`, no trust dialog), `before_agent_start` returned the digest as a persistent context message, the model quoted the lab's `SESSION START -` heading back on its first turn, `state/.session-start-complete` was recorded, and `state/.lock` named the omp process, so ancestry detection identified the markerless binary.
omp's `session_start` payload carries no reason field, so the adapter derives the source: the first start of the process is `startup` (or `resume` from a `--continue`/`--resume` launch line) and a later in-process start is `clear`; `tests/fm-omp-harness.test.sh` pins that mapping over a fake omp API.
A file named both by `-e` and by auto-discovery loads twice (two factory calls, doubled `session_stop` continuations), which is why the secondmate launch names no `-e` and the per-task worker extension lives in `state/`.

### Run-tier source vocabulary and context-reset injection

The run tier depends on three facts only the vendor can supply: the session-open source it reports, whether hook stdout reaches model context on a context-RESET open rather than only a cold one, and whether a worker the hook detaches survives the hook returning.
The first two were measured on 2026-08-05 against a throwaway Firstmate-shaped lab carrying each harness's own tracked registration with a recorder standing in for `bin/fm-sessionstart-run.sh`.
Each open printed a source-stamped token, and the model was asked to quote that token back, so producing hook stdout could never be mistaken for delivering it.
The third is recorded below.

| Harness | Version verified | Cold open | Context reset | Context-preserving reopen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | codex-cli 0.146.0 | `source=startup` under `codex exec`, token quoted back | Not reachable from a tracked project registration; see the limit below | `codex exec resume --last` reports `source=resume` |
| Pi | 0.82.0 | `source=startup`, token quoted back in both `-p` and the TUI | `/new` raises `session_start` reason `new`, which the extension maps to `clear`; `/compact` raises `session_compact`, and both freshly injected source-stamped tokens were quoted back | `pi -c` reports reason `startup`, not `resume` |

Two harness-specific consequences are load-bearing rather than incidental.

Codex's interactive TUI fired no project `SessionStart` hook at all in the same lab where `codex exec` fired it reliably, which matches the earlier 2026-07-28 finding for 0.145.0.
Codex's run tier is therefore verified only for `codex exec` startup and context-preserving resume.
The interactive TUI is a known uncovered gap: Firstmate has no tracked session-open, compaction, or re-emit channel there, ships no global hook, and does not claim instruction-refresh delivery for that surface.

Pi compaction was verified on 2026-08-05 with Pi 0.82.0 in the same throwaway lab after setting `.pi/settings.json` `compaction.keepRecentTokens` to 200 and completing one substantial assistant-prose turn before issuing `/compact`.
Pi reported `Compacted from 7,697 tokens`, the recorder observed `session_compact`, and the model quoted the freshly injected `source=compact` token back.
Both preconditions are load-bearing: the stock 20,000-token keep window exceeds a small lab session, and `AgentSession.compact()` aborts an in-flight turn before measuring compactable history, which otherwise discards that turn and reports `Nothing to compact (session too small)`.
Tool output alone does not grow compactable context; the completed assistant prose does.

Observed compaction output and recorder source:

```text
Compacted from 7,697 tokens
compact
```

Pi disagrees with Codex on `resume`: a new Pi process continuing a session reports `startup`, and Pi's `resume` reason is reserved for an in-process session switch.
The current adapter classification and baseline mechanics are owned by [`../sessionstart-nudge.md`](../sessionstart-nudge.md#harness-transports) and the `bin/fm-session-start.sh` header.
Their continuation classification is covered by portable tests, not claimed as live validation in this record.

### Pi `/new` provider prerequisite

The real offline Pi regression ran on 2026-08-26 with Pi 0.84.0, an isolated home and session directory, a barrier-controlled native digest, and a deterministic local `streamSimple` provider.
The provider makes no HTTP request and requires no user credential.
Its missing-native branch deliberately requests `bin/fm-session-start.sh`, so an escaped first call reproduces the duplicate-producing manual path rather than passing vacuously.

```sh
FM_PI_SESSIONSTART_RACE_LIVE_E2E=1 \
  tests/fm-sessionstart-hook-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - Pi 0.84.0: immediate and completed-before-prompt /new paths each made one first provider call with exactly one native startup context and no manual execution
# fm-sessionstart-hook-live-e2e.test.sh: offline Pi /new race assertions passed
```

The immediate case submitted its first prompt only after the native `clear` child published `started`, held the child behind a release barrier, and proved the provider log remained absent for 500 milliseconds before release.
After release, the first payload reported one native context and no manual result, the session persisted one matching custom message, and the fixture recorded one native execution.
The control case let native generation complete before prompt submission and produced the same first-payload result.
The portable public-event regression in `tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh` separately covers interruption, process-tree retirement, two rapid replacements, stale completion, empty output, spawn error, timeout output, truncation, ineligible stand-down, and compaction cancellation.
Pi and pi-signed load the same tracked extension bytes; pi-signed was not installed on this host for a separate 0.84.0 live rerun.

### Post-start instruction refresh

The isolated real-Pi instruction-refresh regression ran on 2026-08-11 with Pi 0.84.0.
It used a scratch `FM_HOME`, a private tmux socket, and a disposable Firstmate checkout.
The historical `origin/main` implementation first reproduced the stale original marker after a real compaction.
The current implementation then recorded `source=startup`, changed and committed the lab's `AGENTS.md`, compacted the same real Pi session, and answered with the replacement marker.
The fixed run also proved that the true-start baseline remained different from the updated file after compaction.

```sh
FM_SESSIONSTART_INSTRUCTION_REFRESH_LIVE_E2E=1 \
FM_SESSIONSTART_INSTRUCTION_REFRESH_REF=origin/main \
FM_SESSIONSTART_INSTRUCTION_REFRESH_EXPECT=stale \
tests/fm-sessionstart-instruction-refresh-live-e2e.test.sh
# ok - Pi 0.84.0 reproduces stale AGENTS.md after a real compact

FM_SESSIONSTART_INSTRUCTION_REFRESH_LIVE_E2E=1 \
tests/fm-sessionstart-instruction-refresh-live-e2e.test.sh
# ok - Pi 0.84.0 re-injects updated AGENTS.md after a real compact in an isolated session
```

This is live coverage only for Pi compaction.
The portable session-start tests cover continuation classification, baseline immutability, and source-routing behavior.
Pi compaction is the only supported stale-cache refresh pair.
Codex exec exposes only startup and context-preserving resume through tracked registration; Codex interactive reset behavior remains uncovered rather than inferred from direct wrapper invocation.

## Semantic busy state

The per-adapter semantic sources behind [`bin/fm-busy-lib.sh`](../../bin/fm-busy-lib.sh) were live-verified on 2026-07-28 against firstmate-launched workers wired exactly as `fm-spawn` writes them.
Each pass polled `state/<id>.busy-state` while a real turn ran.

| Harness | Version verified | Semantic source | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pi | 0.82.0 | Extension `agent_start` / `agent_settled` with `ctx.isIdle()` | The spawn seed `busy source=fm-spawn`, then `busy source=pi-ext event=agent-start`, then `idle source=pi-ext event=agent-settled`; the turn-end marker was still touched. |
| omp | 18.1.11 | Extension `agent_start` / `agent_end` without `willContinue` | Live Herdr scout on `openai-codex/gpt-6-astra` (2026-09-05): the spawn seed `busy source=fm-spawn`, then `busy source=omp-ext event=agent-start`, then `idle source=omp-ext event=agent-end` at the natural end of the brief; a steer through `fm-send` reopened `busy … agent-start`, and a control-plane interrupt closed it with `idle … agent-end` (omp fires `agent_end` on an interrupted turn). `ctx.isIdle()` is deliberately not consulted because it reads false at a natural TUI `agent_end`. |
| OpenCode | 1.17.18 | Plugin `session.status` | In a real TUI pane: seed, then `busy source=opencode-plugin event=session-busy`, then `idle source=opencode-plugin event=session-status-idle`. |
| Codex | codex-cli 0.145.0 | None usable | See below; classifies `unknown codex-unverified`. |
| Kimi (standalone) | not installed | None usable | No binary on `PATH`, so the gate stays closed and it classifies `unknown kimi-unverified`. |
| Grok | 0.2.112 | Isolated rendered-tail fallback | Retained unconverted; the approved audit could not credit a live structured-lifecycle run. |

Codex was probed two ways, both refused:

```sh
codex app-server daemon start
codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust 'Reply with exactly PROBE2.'
```

The daemon refused with `managed standalone Codex install not found`, and an interactive TUI worker neither starts nor attaches to the app-server control socket, so no client can observe its turns.
In this 2026-07-28 Codex 0.145.0 semantic-busy probe, Firstmate-written lifecycle project hooks under `<worktree>/.codex/hooks.json` fired for neither an interactive pane whose directory trust was granted nor `codex exec`, in both cases with `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`, while an untracked global probe fired in the same runs; Firstmate does not ship, install, recommend, or depend on that global path.
Codex also exposes no `StopFailure` hook, so an API-error turn end would need separate coverage even after hook discovery works.
The app-server protocol schema does define the required lifecycle (`turn/started`, plus a `turn/completed` status of `completed`, `interrupted`, `failed`, or `inProgress`), so the gate is a reachability problem rather than a protocol gap.

## Turn-end guard

The blocking and bounded-follow-up mechanisms were validated across the supported primary runtimes on 2026-07-08 through 2026-09-05, with omp's blocking `session_stop` hook validated on 2026-09-05.

| Harness | Version verified | Mechanism | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | 0.142.1 | Blocking `Stop` hook | Hook process root stayed anchored to the trusted checkout and one continuation ran. |
| OpenCode | 1.17.6 | Passive `session.idle` callback | Throwing could not block, while `promptAsync` scheduled one TUI follow-up; headless remained fail-open. |
| Pi | 0.80.5 | Passive `agent_settled` callback | Exactly one guard follow-up ran for an unhealthy cycle, with no recursion across tool turns. |
| omp | 18.1.11 | Blocking `session_stop` hook returning `{ continue: true, additionalContext }` | In the isolated rpc lab (2026-09-05), the successor watcher was frozen with `SIGSTOP` until its beacon passed the lab `FM_GUARD_GRACE` of 20s while its arm child stayed attached (a killed watcher closes its arm child and the extension re-arms before the guard can fire); the next turn end raised the guard, the guard spy recorded `rc=2` followed by a stop carrying `stop_hook_active: true`, omp compelled a continuation carrying the `turn-end-guard` operational text, the `fm_watch_arm_omp` invocation count then rose to at least two, and a live watcher held the home lock after the thaw; the flagged stop was allowed, so exactly one continuation ran. `session_stop` never fired for an interrupted turn. |
| Grok | 0.2.112 native and 0.2.73 pre-native | Running-payload adaptive `Stop` | Native false-to-true continuation stayed in one process with two model turns and zero resume launches; the field-absent pre-native process launched exactly one guarded resume. |

The Grok adaptive matrix ran on 2026-07-28 with separate scratch repositories and homes, dedicated tmux sockets, one target plus one control window, ambient tmux variables removed, and a socket-bound wrapper first in `PATH`.

```sh
FM_GROK_STOP_LIVE_E2E=1 \
  FM_GROK_NATIVE_BIN="$native_grok_0_2_112" \
  FM_GROK_LEGACY_BIN="$official_pre_native_grok_0_2_73" \
  tests/fm-grok-stop-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed bounded output:

```text
ok - grok 0.2.112 (9bbd559437aa) [stable] native Stop kept one session across false->true, two model turns, and zero resume processes
ok - grok 0.2.73 (9ff14c43bbe5) [stable] legacy Stop omitted capability, resumed exactly once, and stopped normally
ok - Grok adaptive Stop real-process matrix passed with exact target cleanup and control-window survival
```

The same run proved the legacy resume carries `GROK_TURNEND_GUARD_ACTIVE=1` and every replacement root is removed after exact target cleanup while its control window survives.

Session-lock ownership in `bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh` is decided against a session's whole contiguous recognized-runtime ancestry rather than one chosen pid.
`tests/fm-session-lock-ancestry.test.sh` pins the supported runtime reporting semantics behind a deterministic process table.
`tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` runs real watcher and arm cycles against durable on-disk state to verify that a delivered reason survives until post-handling acknowledgement and stops replaying after acknowledgement, while an unrelated queue append cannot make a watcher cycle that delivered nothing look successful.
The same suite ingests a keyed remote-secondmate parent reply through the real adapter, establishes the incremental OPEN DECISIONS cursor, interrupts supervision, and proves re-arm replays every unacknowledged queue row plus the still-open decision through the ordinary drain path.
It also covers decision-only recovery, interrupted handling, handling-window generation reuse, non-fatal moved-generation acknowledgement with sequence-bounded consumption, and a persistent successor remaining live after recovery is acknowledged.

```

The Pi extension-model pull-guard correction (`bin/fm-guard.sh` no longer reports a false watcher-down on a Pi primary during the extension's own watcher hand-off) was verified on 2026-08-13 with the installed ShellCheck 0.11.0 and isolated behavior suites.
The guard verdict itself reads only state files and process liveness, so the portable suites are the enforcing evidence; `bin/fm-harness.sh`'s Pi marker detection, which selects the model, is exercised in the same suite through `PI_CODING_AGENT`.

```sh
bin/fm-lint.sh
bin/fm-doc-audience-check.sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-guard-stale-banner.test.sh tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh tests/fm-session-start.test.sh tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
fm-lint.sh: ShellCheck 0.11.0 (pinned 0.11.0)
fm-doc-audience-check: ok surfaces=67 local_links=243
FM_TEST_SUMMARY total=5 failed=0 skipped_gate=0 duration_ms=280160
```

The same correction was verified against a live Pi primary's own supervision evidence on 2026-08-13.
The hand-off was captured live at beacon age 63s, then the home's `state/.lock`, `state/.last-watcher-beat`, both `state/.pi-*-extension-loaded` markers, and both `.pi/extensions/*.ts` builds were copied into an isolated fixture with no watcher lock.
The fixture's copied beacon was fresh at 0s in the output below; the deterministic stale-beacon case separately verifies the grace boundary.

```sh
FM_SUPERVISION_MODEL=persistent FM_GUARD_READ_ONLY=1 bin/fm-guard.sh
FM_SUPERVISION_MODEL=extension FM_GUARD_READ_ONLY=1 bin/fm-guard.sh
```

Observed output, before and after the model correction, then with the recorded Pi session pid replaced by a dead one:

```text
●  WATCHER DOWN - SUPERVISION IS OFF
●  1 task(s) in flight, but no live watcher process holds this home lock (last beat: 0s ago).
(silent)
●  WATCHER DOWN - SUPERVISION IS OFF
●  1 task(s) in flight, but no live watcher process holds this home lock (last beat: 0s ago).
```

The broader relevant regression pass was rerun on 2026-08-02 without live-home or daemon mutation.

```sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh tests/fm-afk-inject-e2e.test.sh tests/fm-afk-return.test.sh tests/fm-x-mode.test.sh tests/fm-backend.test.sh tests/fm-backend-tmux-smoke.test.sh tests/fm-secondmate-safety.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
FM_TEST_SUMMARY total=8 failed=0 skipped_gate=0 duration_ms=617507
```

## Watcher continuity

The cross-harness evidence combines the supported-runtime live passes against isolated project and home state.
No credential material was copied into a fixture.

```

| Harness | Exact opt-in command | Observed guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `FM_CODEX_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-codex-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` | The one-second foreground checkpoint returned without switching to the arm wrapper. |
| OpenCode | `FM_OPENCODE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-opencode-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | A verified successor existed before prompt handling, with no model re-arm or turn-end fallback. |
| Pi | `FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | One initial tool call led to extension-owned successors and clean child retirement on exit. |
| omp | `FM_OMP_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-omp-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | One initial `fm_watch_arm_omp` invocation (the openai-codex model reaches extension tools through omp's `xd://` virtual-file bridge, a `write` to `xd://fm_watch_arm_omp`, counted as the same invocation) started a live watcher; an actionable close spawned a ledger-linked successor and woke main exactly once; the lab is reaped by path, and omp 18.1.11 did not exit within 30s of its rpc stdin closing, recorded as a note. omp 18.1.11, 2026-09-05. |
| Grok | `FM_GROK_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-grok-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` | Native task completion surfaced the actionable close and the cycle ledger recorded `reason=actionable-signal`. |

Pi 0.81.1 repeated the continuity and clean-exit lifecycle on 2026-07-23 after the Calm presentation changes.

Pi same-process session-transition ownership was verified on 2026-09-01 against the tracked extension with provider-free public lifecycle events, retained and fresh extension-module rebinds, and real arm children:

```sh
pi --version
tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh
tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: after ordinary `session_shutdown` for `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, and reload, plus same-instance shutdown-plus-start, an owning `session_start` armed the replacement generation before any model turn and without the `watcher: not armed - Pi session is shutting down` refusal.
A fresh module rebind also received exactly once the actionable close whose first delivery was still in flight at shutdown, while retaining one live successor.
Stale prior-generation tool callbacks could not mutate the active child, repeated transitions kept exactly one live arm cycle, and terminal `quit` still refused late rearm.
The strict no-emit check used the installed Pi SDK declarations to hold the lifecycle event contract.
Plain Pi and pi-signed share the same tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` path, so both inherit the generation owner; other primary harnesses are not applicable because they do not use this Pi extension lifecycle.

On 2026-09-02 the same suite, the strict typecheck, and the credential-free real-SDK guard were rerun against `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.84.4 after the extension stopped waiting for `before_agent_start` before settling a main delivery; [`runtime-backends.md`](runtime-backends.md#2026-09-02-streaming-time-watcher-delivery) owns the exact commands and output.
Observed guarantee: a wake delivered while main was streaming was followed by a verified successor and by delivery of the next actionable close, a replacement replayed only the follow-up Pi had not consumed, an exhausted restoration delivered its typed failure without launching an arm past the retry bound, and a verified successor that failed while a branch settlement still held its wake took the ordinary bounded retry once that delivery settled.

The once-per-generation recovery bound and immediate handling-successor poll were verified on 2026-08-21 with the tracked Pi extension, real watcher processes, and an isolated home.
The regression forced handling confirmation to fail, observed one recovery follow-up across the former repeat window, confirmed the successor remained live, and then proved a separate handling successor durably queued a crew event within the bounded poll window.

```sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-watch-recovery-loop.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - a resurfacing handling successor stays alive and supervises instead of going blind
ok - unacknowledged recovery is announced at most once per generation and the successor stays alive

## Wedge-alarm channels

The two real notification channels were bounded manually on 2026-07-10 on macOS 26.5.2 with Herdr 0.7.3.
Automated suites never execute these real notification commands.

Argv-safe Notification Center command:

```sh
/usr/bin/osascript \
  -e 'on run argv' \
  -e 'display notification (item 1 of argv) with title "FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE" sound name "Basso"' \
  -e 'end run' \
  'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)'
```

Observed output: no stdout, exit 0, and one banner with the supplied body.

Herdr command:

```sh
herdr notification show 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE' \
  --body 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)' \
  --sound request
```

Observed output:

```json
{"id":"cli:notification:show","result":{"reason":"shown","shown":true,"type":"notification_show"}}
```

The safe command-channel contract is covered without a notification by `tests/fm-daemon.test.sh`: the summary reaches both `$1` and stdin, every channel is process-group bounded, and a failed channel falls through.
