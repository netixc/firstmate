# Watcher arm PreToolUse seatbelt

This document is the authoritative human-readable contract for the watcher arm PreToolUse seatbelt.
`bin/fm-arm-command-policy.mjs` is the single semantic owner.
`bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh` is only the stable Pi transport and output renderer.
The tracked Pi extension forwards command text without classifying it.
`bin/fm-arm-command-policy.mjs` is also the sole owner of firstmate's shell classification: it exports the tokenizer and command-position analysis, which the sibling cd-guard seatbelt (`bin/fm-cd-pretool-check.sh`, `docs/cd-guard.md`) reuses instead of duplicating shell lexing.

## Purpose and boundary

A firstmate primary must arm `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` through an observable harness call.
A shell background operator, pipeline, redirection, wrapper, or unrelated command list can hide failure or let the watcher child die with the tool call.
The seatbelt rejects those command shapes before execution.

This policy is not a post-arm liveness guarantee.
`bin/fm-guard.sh` and `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` apply their respective post-arm supervision predicates to the watcher lock and beacon after an allowed call.

The classifier never executes, sources, evaluates, or expands any part of the submitted command.
It tokenizes the bytes and classifies lexical execution positions only.

## Transport and fail-open behavior

`bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh` accepts `--command <exact string>` from Pi.

The wrapper discovers the code root from its own location.
The active firstmate home is `${FM_HOME:-<code-root>}`.
It passes both roots and the exact command string to the Node policy owner.

The wrapper fast-allows a command without invoking the Node policy owner only when the command cannot contain the `fm-watch` byte sequence even after the classifier's decoders run.
The fast path may allow only when both of these hold:

1. The stripped text lacks the `fm-watch` watcher substring, after mirroring the classifier's cheapest byte normalizations - dropping line-continuation and escape backslashes, quotes, and newlines.
2. The raw command carries no quoting-decoder marker: a `$` immediately followed by a single quote (ANSI-C `$'...'`) or a double quote (bash locale `$"..."`).

Any `fm-watch` match or any quoting-decoder marker delegates to the classifier.
Normalizing first keeps this a strict superset: a protected watcher path obfuscated as `fm-watc\<newline>h-arm.sh` or `fm-"watch"-arm.sh` still delegates, and stripping only those non-alphanumeric bytes can never destroy an existing `fm-watch` run.
The quoting-decoder marker closes the case the byte strip cannot: `bin/fm-$'\x77'atch-arm.sh` and `bin/fm-$"watch"-arm.sh` both resolve to `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` only after the classifier decodes the encoded character, so a cheap byte strip would otherwise lose the `fm-watch` bytes and fast-allow them.
This marker set is coupled to the classifier's decoder set in `bin/fm-arm-command-policy.mjs`: adding any new quote or expansion form the classifier decodes requires extending this marker set in the same change, or the prefilter stops being a strict superset.
The prefilter owns no semantic exception: it can only ever fast-allow a command that is definitely not a watcher command, so it never flips a classification and the classifier remains the single owner of every decision.

The seatbelt's threat model is agent mistakes: no one accidentally writes an ANSI-C- or locale-obfuscated watcher path, and deliberate obfuscation is the post-arm liveness guard's territory.
The marker guard closes the static gap anyway because it is cheap and provable per encoding class.
Tripwire: if a third strict-superset gap is ever found after this marker generalization, that falsifies the "provable per encoding class" claim and the decision flips to Option B - drop the prefilter and always invoke the classifier.
Deeper decode-required obfuscation beyond the coupled marker set stays the classifier's and the post-arm liveness guards' responsibility.

Missing Node, a missing classifier, or an invalid classifier response fail open with exit 0 and no output.
This transport behavior prevents a broken hook from denying every shell tool call.
Malformed or unsupported shell syntax that contains a protected command is a semantic classification result and fails closed.

## Command-position classification

The tokenizer recognizes cooked words with quote provenance, comments, heredoc bodies, shell list operators, pipelines, redirections, command and process substitutions, parenthesized subshells, brace groups, and literal nested execution payloads.
Quoted text, comments, heredoc bodies, and later argument words are data positions unless a recognized execution sink recursively executes them.

A command word in executed position is a protected execution when its normalized path suffix matches one of the protected watcher scripts:

```text
bin/fm-watch-arm.sh          (arm; blessed entry point)
bin/fm-watch.sh              (watch; protected but never blessed)
```

The relative form, the `<code-root>`-anchored absolute form, and any word ending in `/bin/<script>` all resolve to that identity.
Suffix matching recognizes an expanded-path prefix statically, so `$FM_HOME/bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`, `$HOME/firstmate/bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`, and `~/firstmate/bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` are the arm identity.
The classifier never expands the variable or tilde; it matches the literal bytes only.
Static quote forms are cooked before the suffix match, so a command word split by ordinary quotes (`fm-"watch"-arm.sh`), ANSI-C quoting (`fm-$'\x77'atch-arm.sh`), or a bash locale string (`fm-$"watch"-arm.sh`) all resolve to the same identity; this reads the fixed literal bytes as the shell would cook them and never runs an expansion or a command.
This covers statically-visible literal words in command position; opaque dynamic dataflow such as `bash -lc "$WHOLE_COMMAND"` remains out of scope.

`bin/fm-watch.sh` is protected but is not a blessed entry point.
A direct `bin/fm-watch.sh` execution - relative, `<code-root>`-anchored, `$VAR`-prefixed, or `~`-prefixed - always denies with `watcher-direct`, whose reason points the caller at `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`.

The same bytes in an argument, comment, assertion, documentation query, Python string, `printf`, or Herdr `pane send-text` payload are data and do not make the outer command relevant.

Literal `sh`, `bash`, or `zsh` `-c` payloads and literal `eval` payloads are recursively classified.
A literal nested payload that only runs a data-bearing command is allowed.
A literal nested payload that executes a protected command is denied as `watcher-nested`, even when that inner protected call would be allowed at top level.

Dynamic payloads such as `bash -lc "$WATCHER_COMMAND"` cannot be proven statically and remain the post-arm guard's responsibility.
If the submitted command first constructs a protected literal assignment and then feeds a dynamic value to a recognized shell or `eval` sink, the classifier denies conservatively as `watcher-nested`.

Comments and heredoc bodies are ignored as execution syntax.
An actual protected command with a heredoc still has a redirection and is denied.

## Blessed syntax tree

An allowed watcher program is one linear outer command list with zero or more approved setup nodes followed by exactly one direct protected node.
`bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` is the only blessed final node, including its expanded-path forms; a `bin/fm-watch.sh` final node is never blessed and denies with `watcher-direct`.

Approved setup nodes are:

- `cd <one path word>`.
- `export NAME=<one shell word>` with no command substitution, process substitution, or redirection.
- `source <Relay cadence path>` or `. <Relay cadence path>`.
- `[ -f <Relay cadence path> ] && source <Relay cadence path>` and the equivalent dot form.

The allowed Relay cadence paths are `config/relay.env`, `./config/relay.env`, and an absolute path that normalizes to `<active-firstmate-home>/config/relay.env`.
An absolute Relay cadence path outside the active home is not an approved setup node.

Approved nodes may be separated by `;`, a real newline, or `&&`.
`&&` is accepted after setup so a failed `cd`, `export`, or source prevents the protected call from running under the wrong setup.

The final protected node may have one immediate `exec` wrapper.
Its arguments are ordinary shell words and may contain quoted semicolons or watcher names.
No other wrapper is approved.

Inline environment assignments, `env`, `sudo`, `nohup`, nested shells, `eval`, subshell groups, substitutions, redirections, pipelines, asynchronous lists, `disown`, unrelated list nodes, and unsupported compound syntax are not blessed.

## Broad watcher kills

An actually executed `pkill` command is denied when its parsed pattern arguments target `fm-watch`.
Path-qualified `pkill`, `command pkill`, and `sudo pkill` are recognized.

`kill "$(pgrep -f '/bin/fm-watch.sh')"` is also denied because the executed `kill` consumes an executed watcher-wide `pgrep` substitution.
A standalone read-only `pgrep` is allowed.
Quoted text such as `echo 'pkill -f fm-watch'` is data and is allowed.

Unsupported compound grammar - a loop, `case`, `if`, or other construct the classifier does not model - is failed closed for broad kills the same way it is for protected executions.
When the command carries such grammar and its raw bytes reference both a `fm-watch` target and a `pkill` or `kill` verb, the classifier cannot prove which command position the kill occupies, so it denies with `broad-watcher-kill` rather than allowing.
This backstop mirrors the protected-execution fail-closed rule and covers forms like `while true; do pkill -f fm-watch; done`, `for x in 1; do pkill -f fm-watch; done`, `case x in x) pkill -f fm-watch ;; esac`, and `until false; do kill $(pgrep -f fm-watch); done`.
It is gated on the grammar being unsupported: in grammar the classifier does model, command-position analysis is authoritative, so data mentions such as `echo 'pkill -f fm-watch'` and a loop that only names the watcher without a kill verb such as `for f in 1; do echo fm-watch; done` remain allowed.

## Stable reason codes

Every semantic deny includes one stable code in square brackets before its prose reason.

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `watcher-background` | A protected execution is in an asynchronous list or uses `nohup` or `disown`. |
| `watcher-pipeline` | A protected execution participates in any pipeline. |
| `watcher-redirection` | A protected execution uses shell redirection. |
| `watcher-bundled` | The outer command list is not the blessed setup-plus-final tree. |
| `watcher-nested` | A wrapper, group, substitution, nested shell, `eval`, or constructed dynamic payload executes the protected command. |
| `broad-watcher-kill` | An actual broad process kill targets the watcher. |
| `unclassifiable-protected-command` | Malformed or unsupported syntax contains a protected command and cannot be safely classified. |
| `watcher-direct` | A direct `bin/fm-watch.sh` execution; the watcher must be reached through `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`. |

Reason codes are the stable contract for tests and adapters.
Prose may improve without changing adapter behavior.

## Output contract

- Allow returns exit 0 with both streams empty.
- Deny returns exit 2 and writes `{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","permissionDecision":"deny"},"systemMessage":"[code] reason"}` to stderr.
- Pi returns `{block: true}` only when the checker exits 2.

## Harness wiring

| Harness | Exact command field | Adapter behavior on checker exit 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pi | `event.input.command` | `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts` passes one `--command` argument and returns `{block: true}` only for exit 2. |

## Live validation record, 2026-07-09

Pi 0.80.5 ran the tracked primary extension in a git-initialized scratch Firstmate project.
The harness allowed unrelated commands and the direct watcher arm, blocked a backgrounded arm with `[watcher-background]`, and left the deny sentinel absent.
The extension also called `fm_watch_arm_pi` and created the scratch automatic-arm marker.

## Automated validation

`tests/fm-arm-pretool-check.test.sh` owns the adversarial acceptance matrix.
Every row runs through Pi-shaped CLI entry forms.
The suite also verifies real newline bytes, direct classifier reason codes, comments, heredoc data, malformed and unsupported protected syntax, constructed dynamic payloads, malformed transport fail-open behavior, missing runtime fail-open behavior, output shapes, and exact adapter field forwarding plus exit-2 mapping.
