# Agent lifecycle control plane

Firstmate talks to a running agent two ways, and they are not the same channel.

The **data plane** is [`bin/fm-send.sh`](../bin/fm-send.sh): conversational text for the agent to read.
For a `kind=secondmate` target it always prepends the from-firstmate routing marker, because a secondmate is itself a firstmate and its reply must come back through the status path rather than a chat nobody reads.

The **control plane** is [`bin/fm-control.sh`](../bin/fm-control.sh): allowlisted lifecycle verbs addressed to an exact task id.

The split exists because the data plane's marking is exactly right for a message and exactly wrong for a lifecycle command.
A routing-marked `/quit` arrives as ordinary chat - `[fm-from-firstmate] /quit` - which the agent reasons about instead of executing.
The failure repeated across homes, and the workaround lived only in agent prose, so it failed again whenever a session did not recall it.

## What the control plane owns

`bin/fm-control-lib.sh` is the single executable owner of the capability tables, with no side effects, so it can be read as a contract:

- The **verb allowlist**: `interrupt`, `exit`, `relaunch`.
  There is no arbitrary-text and no generic raw-key entry point.
  A caller either names an allowlisted verb or is refused.
- **Pi mechanics**: Escape cancels a running turn, `/quit` exits Pi, and ship, scout, and secondmate tasks are supported.
  The [`harness-adapters`](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md) skill points here rather than duplicating those facts.
  `bin/fm-send.sh`'s `--key` path reads the composer-clear table from this owner too.
- **Per-backend capability**: which named keys a runtime backend can deliver, and whether it has a recovery-grade agent-state classifier able to prove an agent stopped.

A recorded `harness=` must be exactly `pi`; unknown or raw-command identities resolve to no control adapter.

## Verbs

| Verb | Effect | Postcondition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interrupt` | Deliver Pi's verified interrupt sequence while leaving the agent running. | Delivery succeeds while the endpoint still exists and the agent is still alive where the backend can classify that; cancellation is confirmed only from an adapter-owned acknowledgement and otherwise reports `cancel=unconfirmed`. |
| `exit` | Stop the agent, preserving the endpoint, the worktree, and every uncommitted change. | The backend's recovery-grade classifier reports the agent gone. Already-stopped is idempotent success. |
| `relaunch` | Replace the running agent with a new one in the same endpoint and worktree, on the exact recorded adapter or an explicitly chosen Pi model and effort. | The new agent is alive on the recorded endpoint, and the durable record names the Pi profile that is actually running. |

An exit that delivers lifecycle input but cannot prove the agent stopped fails with `exit=unconfirmed`, reports the observed agent state and any interrupt cancellation claim, and never claims that nothing changed.
Interrupt never rewrites busy state as proof of its own success.

An interrupt is not complete until the composer is empty.
If Pi's control contract names a post-interrupt clear key, the clear is refused before anything is sent when the recorded backend cannot deliver it.

**Teardown and discard are not verbs and will not become verbs.**
`exit` stops an agent and preserves everything else.
Removing a worktree, closing an endpoint, or discarding work stays with [`bin/fm-teardown.sh`](../bin/fm-teardown.sh), which owns the landed-work test.

**`resume` is not a verb.**
Pi has no verified pane-resume contract.
`relaunch` covers the need because the instructions on disk - not a runtime-private session - are durable.

## Transactional relaunch

`relaunch` is the only verb that changes durable records, so it runs as a transaction with a journal at `state/<id>.control-relaunch`, the prior record preserved beside it, and a ship or scout's prior instructions preserved when a progress note is appended.

1. **Resolve the profile.**
   Only `--harness pi` is accepted.
   Explicit `--model` or `--effort` wins; otherwise a secondmate re-resolves optional tokens from `config/secondmate-harness`, while a ship or scout keeps its recorded model and effort from intake.
2. **Safe checkpoint.**
   The recorded worktree must exist and be a worktree root; its head and dirty state are recorded.
   For a `kind=secondmate` task, the home's identity marker must match and its child records must be readable, so a relaunch can never strand child work behind an unreadable home.
   A secondmate's own crewmates run in their own endpoints and outlive its relaunch; the relaunched secondmate reconciles them from its home's durable records at startup.
3. **Record the note.**
   A ship or scout relaunch requires `--note`, because the replacement inherits the local copy but none of the conversation; the note is appended to the instructions it reads.
   A secondmate relaunch does not require one and never rewrites its standing charter.
4. **Stop the old agent** through the `exit` verb, with its postcondition.
5. **Launch the replacement** through its single owner, `bin/fm-spawn.sh --relaunch`, which adopts the recorded endpoint and worktree instead of creating either, clears Pi's previous per-task wiring, and arms a fresh busy generation.


### Failure and rollback

- A refusal **before** the agent is stopped leaves the durable record and the instructions byte-identical.
- A launch failure **after** the agent is stopped restores the prior durable record, keeps the progress note so a later recovery still has it, marks the journal `failed:launching`, and reports plainly that no agent is running and where the work is preserved.
- If the launch owner already published the new record but no running agent can be confirmed, the new record is kept: the task retains the newly published Pi profile with no agent confirmed, which is exactly what recovery reconciles.
  Rewriting it back to the old profile would be a second, worse inaccuracy.

## Fail-closed boundaries

- Targeting is exact.
  Only a bare task id with a `state/<id>.meta` record in this home is accepted, and that record must pass the shared endpoint-identity validation.
  A legacy `fm-<id>` window label, an explicit `session:window` endpoint, and a record whose `endpoint_task_id` names another task are all refused.
- A remotely placed secondmate is refused by name.
  Its agent runs on another host, so none of the postconditions this plane verifies could be read for it here; local endpoint validation would refuse the record regardless, because `window=remote:<id>` can never match a local backend's required shape.
  Drive that lifecycle on its own host and reconcile it through the secondmate recovery path.
  For `relaunch` that host-side drive is `bin/fm-on.sh <id> fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh relaunch ...`, whose host-local leg runs this same plane against a record that is ordinary and local there, so every checkpoint, journal, rollback, and postcondition below applies unchanged ([`docs/remote-secondmates.md`](remote-secondmates.md)); `interrupt` and `exit` have no such route.
- Any runtime other than Pi, including a raw launch command, is refused before the agent or durable record is touched.
- A backend that cannot deliver Pi's interrupt key or required composer clear is refused rather than sent a different key.
- `exit` and `relaunch` require tmux or Herdr, both of which have recovery-grade agent-state classifiers.
- An ambiguous or unreadable endpoint state refuses.
  Only a positively classified state acts.
- `fm-spawn --relaunch` independently refuses unless the recorded endpoint is positively agent-free, so a replacement can never join a live agent.
  It also requires the shell to be in the recorded worktree: tmux refuses immediately when it is not, while Herdr sends one `cd` to the recorded path and refuses unless a subsequent path read confirms the move.

## Capability matrix

| Backend | Escape | Enter | Ctrl+C | Ctrl+U | Recovery-grade agent state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tmux | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| herdr | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |

Pi's interrupt, exit, and supported-kind contract lives in `bin/fm-control-lib.sh` and is exercised by `tests/fm-control.test.sh`.

## Verification

- `tests/fm-control.test.sh` - the Pi lifecycle contract, the backend capability matrix, exact-id scoping, the closed verb list, the busy, idle, dead, and idempotent lifecycle cases, and marker non-regression, all against a stubbed session provider.
- `tests/fm-control-relaunch.test.sh` - the relaunch transaction: identity and profile preservation, the progress note, checkpoint refusals, and rollback after a failed launch.
- `tests/fm-control-herdr-smoke.test.sh` - the second state-verified backend against the real herdr binary, on an isolated throwaway lab session.
