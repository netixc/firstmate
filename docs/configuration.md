# Configuration

The files and environment variables you set to operate firstmate.

## Orchestrator behavior (AGENTS.md)

The shared orchestrator behavior lives in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) - edit it like any prompt when the fleet is empty, or dispatch shared-repo edits to a crewmate while tasks are in flight.

## Operational home layout and state

This section is the single owner of the top-level operational-home layout; producer script headers and their help own exact child-file fields and mutation contracts.
The tracked code root contains the shared instruction, skill, documentation, workflow, and `bin/` surfaces, while each effective `FM_HOME` contains private operational directories.
`data/` holds durable private fleet records such as the project and secondmate registries, captain preferences, optional shared captain preferences, learnings, backlog, briefs, and scout reports.
`state/` holds runtime records such as task metadata, append-only status events, endpoint signals, watcher and wake-queue coordination, inactive terminal-outcome receipts under `state/terminal-outcomes/`, away-mode state, generated Relay artifacts, private secondmate config-reread generations with their retry and quarantine state, and parent-owned secondmate pending-reply records under `state/pending-replies/` (`bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh`).
`config/` holds local gitignored operating choices, and `projects/` holds the local project clones that Firstmate reads but changes only through the narrow guarded and concrete captain-approved exceptions in `AGENTS.md`.

`bin/fm-spawn.sh` owns the base task-metadata fields it emits, while the runtime-backend section below owns backend-specific fields and selector interpretation.
The producing PR and Relay helpers own the fields they append, `bin/fm-classify-lib.sh` owns status-event vocabulary, and `bin/fm-crew-state.sh` owns current-state reconciliation.
Wake, watcher, away-mode, and Relay-specific state mechanics remain with their named scripts and reference sections rather than being duplicated into one exhaustive state tree here.

`bin/fm-session-start.sh`'s header is the single owner of session-start ordering, composed commands, digest contents, and the digest's startup mechanism.
`bin/fm-startup-network.sh`'s header owns the deferred network stage that keeps every external-network call off that digest's blocking path, including its state files and the safety argument for running them later.
`docs/sessionstart-nudge.md` owns the native session-open adapter tiers that run or nudge the digest command, and the source routing between them.
`AGENTS.md` retains the run-once and read-once operator rules, lock-refusal safety, installation consent, and direct-report recovery boundaries because those facts apply at every session start.
Ordinary dead-direct-report recovery is owned by `stuck-crewmate-recovery`, while persistent-secondmate recovery is owned by `secondmate-provisioning`.

## Pi Calm preference (config/calm)

The Pi Calm extension stores the captain's home-local presentation choice in gitignored `config/calm` under the effective Firstmate home, resolved from `FM_HOME`, then `FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE`, then the tracked code root derived from the extension path, or under `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` when that test and specialized-setup override is present.
The values it writes are `on` and `off`, each followed by one newline; an absent, unreadable, or unrecognized value defaults to off.
`max` is the legacy value written by a removed third presentation level whose behavior is now ordinary Calm, and it is still read as `on`, so a home upgraded from it keeps Calm on rather than dropping to off.
The `/calm` command replaces the file atomically before changing live presentation, so a failed write leaves the current choice unchanged rather than claiming persistence.
The extension reloads this preference on every Pi `session_start`, including startup, new, resume, fork, and reload reasons.
This preference is local to each Firstmate home and is not part of secondmate inherited configuration.

## Backlog backend (.tasks.toml / config/backlog-backend)

The tracked `.tasks.toml` pins the default `tasks-axi` markdown backend to `data/backlog.md`, with `done_keep = 10` and an archive at `data/done-archive.md`.
When the default backend is selected and compatible `tasks-axi` is on `PATH`, firstmate uses its verbs for routine backlog mutations.
Secondmate handoffs are separate and unconditional: `fm-backlog-handoff.sh` keeps only its own fleet-level validation and always delegates the item move to `tasks-axi mv`, the single owner of the backlog format.
It moves in-scope `## Queued` items only and refuses `## In flight` and historical `## Done` records, which stay with their home for pruning or archiving.
Handoff item bodies must use at least two leading spaces, and the helper refuses a selected item with a single-space or tab-indented continuation rather than risk orphaning it.
Because bootstrap requires `tasks-axi` on `PATH` on every profile, that delegation works fleet-wide, and the `config/backlog-backend=manual` knob governs firstmate's own hand-editing of its backlog, not this validated helper.
Compatible means the installed build passes the shared version and feature probe owned by [`bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh), including the atomic multi-ID move required by handoff delegation.
Bootstrap requires compatible `tasks-axi` on every profile; see "Toolchain" below for missing-tool reporting and silent default-backend behavior.
Set the local, gitignored `config/backlog-backend` file to `manual` to force manual backlog editing and suppress the verbose `BOOTSTRAP_INFO: tasks-axi available` fact, not missing-tool reporting.
Absent or `tasks-axi` selects the default tasks-axi backend.
The file format is unchanged in both modes; tasks-axi and manual edits produce the same `## In flight`, `## Queued`, and `## Done` sections.

## Runtime backend (config/backend / FM_BACKEND)

The supported runtime session-provider backends are the verified tmux reference backend and experimental Herdr.
See [`docs/tmux-backend.md`](tmux-backend.md) and [`docs/herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md).
Treehouse provides task worktrees for both backends.
New spawns choose the backend in this order: an explicit `--backend` flag authorized for that exact task, then `FM_BACKEND`, then the first non-empty line of local gitignored `config/backend`, then runtime auto-detection from `$TMUX` or `HERDR_ENV=1`, then default `tmux`.
When both markers are present, `$TMUX` wins because it is the innermost session provider.
Auto-detected Herdr prints a stderr notice naming `config/backend` and `--backend tmux` as opt-outs; auto-detected tmux stays silent.
Any value other than `tmux` or `herdr` is rejected.
`codex-app` is not an accepted runtime backend; [`docs/codex-app-backend.md`](codex-app-backend.md) owns that boundary.
A backend spawn refusal from a missing dependency or version gate is terminal for that selection rather than silently retrying another backend.
Task metadata records `backend=` only for Herdr; an absent `backend=` means tmux.
Every new task records `endpoint_task_id=` as the cleanup binding between the metadata filename and runtime endpoint.
A Herdr task additionally records `herdr_session=`, `herdr_workspace_id=`, `herdr_tab_id=`, and `herdr_pane_id=`.
Task selectors for `fm-peek.sh`, `fm-send.sh`, and `fm-crew-state.sh` resolve centrally through `fm_backend_resolve_selector`.
A selector containing `:` is passed through as an explicit backend endpoint escape hatch.
Otherwise an exact task id matching `state/<id>.meta` wins before the legacy `fm-<id>` label fallback, and metadata routing returns the recorded `window=` target.
Matching explicit targets can recover the recorded backend when metadata contains the same endpoint.
Only metadata-routed task selectors carry secondmate-marker and Codex-harness context.
`fm-teardown.sh <id>` validates the complete metadata-only endpoint identity before any runtime dispatch or cleanup mutation.
Missing, empty, duplicate, malformed, backend-inconsistent, or task-mismatched endpoint records are preserved and refused.
Legacy tmux metadata remains cleanup-compatible when its exact window name is `fm-<id>`; Herdr endpoints require their recorded `endpoint_task_id=` binding.
The session-start secondmate liveness sweep uses the recovery-grade `fm_backend_agent_state` classifier; the comment above that function in `bin/fm-backend.sh` owns its detailed state contract and recovery authorization.
A Herdr spawn version-gates the installed binary's protocol and requires `jq`.
`FM_HOME` determines Herdr's home label, and [`herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md#watching-and-task-containers) owns workspace placement, collision handling, and recovery behavior.
The local `config/herdr-presentation-spaces` file controls Herdr's presentation projection as described in [Presentation spaces](herdr-backend.md#presentation-spaces).
`config/backend` and `config/herdr-presentation-spaces` are inherited into secondmate homes under the primary-authoritative contract owned by [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md).
For normal Herdr operations, `HERDR_SESSION` selects the named session, but destructive test cleanup must use the guarded path in [`docs/herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md).

## Away-mode supervisor backend (FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND / FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET)

The `/afk` sub-supervisor injects escalation digests into firstmate's own pane independently of where new task endpoints are spawned.
It currently supports only `tmux` and `herdr` supervisor panes.
Set `FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND=tmux|herdr` and `FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET=<target>` to override both axes explicitly; for herdr the target is `"<session>:<pane-id>"`.
Without overrides, backend detection uses `$TMUX_PANE` first, then `HERDR_ENV=1` with `HERDR_PANE_ID`, then falls back to `tmux`.
That keeps a tmux pane nested inside herdr on the tmux transport, matching the runtime backend's innermost-first rule.
Target detection uses `FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET`, then `$TMUX_PANE`, then `"${HERDR_SESSION:-default}:${HERDR_PANE_ID}"` under herdr, then the legacy `firstmate:0` tmux fallback with a warning.
Selecting any other supervisor backend refuses at daemon startup instead of trying tmux injection primitives against a non-tmux pane.

## Away-mode wedge alarm channels (config/wedge-alarm)

When away-mode injection wedges past `FM_MAX_DEFER_SECS`, the sub-supervisor raises a loud, rate-limited alarm.
Beyond the durable `state/.subsuper-inject-wedged` marker and the tmux status-line flash, it attempts a configured backend-independent active alert that can reach the captain even when every pane and its backend status-line is unreadable.
`config/wedge-alarm` (local, gitignored) lists channel directives, one per non-empty, non-comment line; every listed non-`off` channel fires, best-effort.
`FM_WEDGE_ALARM_CHANNEL` overrides the file with a single directive.
Directives are `off` (a position-independent kill switch that disables every active alert), `auto`/`default`, `osascript` (macOS Notification Center banner), `herdr` (herdr UI notification), and `command:<cmd>` (run `<cmd>` via `sh -c`, summary on `$1` and stdin).
An absent file means `auto`, i.e. default-on on macOS: the alarm exists precisely so a wedged away-mode primary is never silent, and it fires at most once per max-defer window after a genuine wedge.
A missing or failing channel logs and falls through to the next, never crashing the daemon.
See [`wedge-alarm.md`](wedge-alarm.md) for the current channel reference, [`verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#wedge-alarm-channels) for active evidence, and [`examples/wedge-alarm`](examples/wedge-alarm) for a copyable config.

## Trace context propagation (config/trace-context / FM_TRACE_CONTEXT)

The optional local, gitignored `config/trace-context` presence flag enables default-off native W3C trace-context propagation.
`FM_TRACE_CONTEXT` overrides the file: `1`/`on`/`true`/`yes` enables, any other non-empty value disables, and unset or empty defers to the file.
Each locked home session resolves those inputs once, and all spawns from that home use the frozen decision until a new session starts.
When launching a Secondmate, the primary copies the presence flag into its home and passes the primary session's frozen decision as a non-empty `FM_TRACE_CONTEXT=on|off` override for the Secondmate's own session start.
A Secondmate on a remote route is covered the same way: the primary resolves and records that task's carrier, and the configured host exports it and receives the same enablement snapshot.
The presence flag is session-scoped enablement, so it transfers at launch and is left unchanged by live convergence into a running home.
See [`trace-context.md`](trace-context.md) for carrier semantics, supported routes, the manual fleet-restart requirement, the session boundary, and safety limits; `bin/fm-trace-context-lib.sh`'s header owns the exact mechanics, and [`verification/trace-context.md`](verification/trace-context.md) records repeatable evidence.

## Gate defaults (.no-mistakes.yaml)

The tracked `.no-mistakes.yaml` keeps test evidence outside the repo and pins `commands.lint` to `bin/fm-lint.sh` so local lint matches CI.
That evidence policy is specific to the firstmate repo: target projects may legitimately commit `.no-mistakes/evidence/` from their own no-mistakes pipeline, but firstmate keeps `.no-mistakes/` local and CI rejects tracked entries under that path.
It does not set `commands.test` to a complete `tests/*.test.sh` walk.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the firstmate-specific local test policy and entry points.
Portable shard evidence and coverage rules are in [fm-test-portable-shards.md](fm-test-portable-shards.md); [herdr-backend.md](herdr-backend.md#destructive-lab-safety) owns the real-Herdr lane's isolation boundary, and [runtime-backends.md](verification/runtime-backends.md#herdr) owns active evidence.

## Captain Preferences (data/captain.md / data/captain-shared.md)

Domain-local preferences for one captain's fleet live locally in each home's `data/captain.md`; it is gitignored and printed in the session-start context digest after `data/projects.md` and optional `data/secondmates.md`.
Before changing it, inspect the current file and curate the matching bullet in place under the internal [`stow` skill's](../.agents/skills/stow/SKILL.md) tiering and archive contract; add a new bullet only for a genuinely new durable preference.
Shared captain preferences that apply across secondmate domains live only in the primary home's optional `data/captain-shared.md`.
`secondmate-provisioning` owns its propagation contract, including the required header, read-only secondmate copies, quarantine diagnostics, and the rollout rule that existing homes trim `data/captain.md` by hand after first propagation rather than deleting private content automatically.

## Operational learnings (data/learnings.md)

Fleet-local operational facts and gotchas live locally in `data/learnings.md`; it is gitignored and printed after the captain-preference files in the session-start context digest.
The file is created lazily on first learning and follows the internal [`stow` skill's](../.agents/skills/stow/SKILL.md) aging-tier and cold-archive contract: inspect the current file first and curate it instead of appending forever.
There is no shared learnings file by captain decision.

## Startup memory budget (config/startup-memory-budget)

`config/startup-memory-budget` is the primary-authoritative per-home allowance for the startup prompt-memory surface: `data/captain.md`, `data/captain-shared.md`, and `data/learnings.md` together.
The locked mutable bootstrap path materializes its visible default of `7500` estimated tokens in a primary home when the file is absent.
To select another allowance, replace the primary home's file with one valid positive value in the exact format below; the next locked bootstrap convergence or `bin/fm-config-push.sh` propagates it to registered secondmates.
A secondmate does not create an independent default and instead receives the primary value through the inherited-local-material contract in [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md).
The file must be one positive base-10 integer followed by exactly one newline in a regular, single-linked file beneath a non-symlinked `config/` directory.
Malformed, multi-line, symlinked, hardlinked, special, or otherwise unsafe values are rejected rather than treated as a default.
Use `bin/fm-startup-memory-budget.sh read` to validate and print the effective value, or `bin/fm-startup-memory-budget.sh report` to account for the three files.
The stable local estimate is `ceil(UTF-8 bytes / 3)` per file, a conservative portable approximation rather than a provider-exact tokenizer.
An inherited `data/captain-shared.md` counts in a secondmate's total but remains primary-owned and read-only there.
The internal [`/stow` skill](../.agents/skills/stow/SKILL.md) owns curation and its automatic secondmate cascade, which accounts every home against this same per-home allowance separately rather than against a fleet total.
The helper's header owns exact parsing, publication, and report output mechanics.

## Secondmate routes (data/secondmates.md)

Persistent secondmate routes live locally in `data/secondmates.md`.
The concise single-line route contract is owned by the [`secondmate-provisioning` skill](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md#routing-table), including the parser-compatible fields, one-sentence summary requirement, `home:` pointer to the seeded charter, and limit on extra registry prose.
A remote route adds `host:` and `root:` before the existing fields and places the whole secondmate home on that SSH host; it does not make ordinary workers remotely placeable.
[`remote-secondmates.md`](remote-secondmates.md) owns current remote setup, operation, and safety behavior.
Use `fm-home-seed.sh validate` to check the complete operational registry contract documented by the command itself.
The main first mate routes by reading those scopes with judgment; the project list is provisioning data, not exclusive ownership.
Use `fm-home-seed.sh <id> - {<project>...|--no-projects}` to lease a fresh local firstmate worktree for the secondmate home.
For remote provisioning, including supplied project origins, follow [Remote second mates](remote-secondmates.md#provision-a-route).
Use the deliberate `--no-projects` signal only for a firstmate-repo domain that needs no separate project clones.
It cannot be combined with a project list, and omitting both still fails loudly.
A project-less seed requires no existing project clones or `data/projects.md` entries in the home, so it refuses a populated-home conversion without changing that home.
A preexisting project-bearing charter is also refused until it is re-scaffolded with `--no-projects` or removed.
The lease is held under the secondmate id until explicit retirement or seed rollback returns it, so normal restarts do not free or recycle the home.
Teardown of a leased home fails closed if `treehouse return` cannot release the lease; plain-clone homes with no treehouse pool slot are removed directly.
Secondmate routes cover `no-mistakes` and `direct-PR` projects; `local-only` projects remain main-firstmate work.
For `no-mistakes` projects, seeding initializes only projects newly cloned into a secondmate home and refuses to mutate a preexisting clone that is not already initialized.
After creating a secondmate, move existing main-backlog queued items that you have judged in-scope with `fm-backlog-handoff.sh <secondmate-id> <item-key>...`; it is idempotent and refuses In flight, Done, or non-secondmate homes.
Set `FM_SECONDMATE_CHARTER` to seed from inline charter text when no filled charter brief exists; set `FM_SECONDMATE_SCOPE` when the routing scope should differ from the charter text.
The seeded home's `data/charter.md` owns the standard secondmate lifecycle and escalation contract; the route file points to it through the existing `home:` field instead of adding another pointer.
Each seed writes an `.fm-secondmate-home` identity marker at the home root, alongside a durable `.fm-secondmate-parent` record of the home's route to its parent (see "Provision a route" in [`docs/remote-secondmates.md`](remote-secondmates.md)).
The tracked root `.gitignore` ignores both markers, so validation can read them without making a freshly seeded home appear dirty to porcelain-based safety checks.
This does not relax protection for any other untracked file.
An existing linked-worktree home that predates this rule advances through its marker-only state during its next bootstrap or spawn local sync, after which Git ignores the marker normally.
A standalone-clone home cannot receive a primary-local commit through that no-fetch sync, so it receives the rule through `/updatefirstmate`'s origin refresh instead.

## FM_HOME

`FM_HOME` selects the operational home for one firstmate instance.
When it is unset, most scripts use the repo root as the home; when it is set, scripts still run from this repo's `bin/`, but `state/`, `data/`, `config/`, and `projects/` come from `$FM_HOME`.
`FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE` overrides the firstmate repo root used by scripts, including the primary checkout watched by the worktree-tangle guard.
When `FM_HOME` is unset, it also behaves as the old whole-root override.
`bin/fm-send.sh` is intentionally stricter than that general fallback: it requires `FM_HOME` to be set before resolving a target, so operator steers cannot silently resolve against the wrong home.
`FM_STATE_OVERRIDE`, `FM_DATA_OVERRIDE`, `FM_PROJECTS_OVERRIDE`, and `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` override individual operational directories for tests and specialized harness setup.
Before `fm-brief.sh`, `fm-spawn.sh`, or `fm-afk-launch.sh` persists a path or passes it to another process, it resolves each applicable relative `FM_HOME`, `FM_STATE_OVERRIDE`, or `FM_DATA_OVERRIDE` directory against the caller's working directory, preserves absolute spellings unchanged, and rejects an unresolvable relative directory with the offending variable named.
Bootstrap applies the same relative `FM_HOME` resolution only when embedding that home in the generated Relay poll shim; other transient consumers retain their existing shell-relative behavior.
For the herdr backend, `FM_HOME` also determines the workspace label used by the adapter.

## Harness support

claude, codex, opencode, pi, pi-signed, grok, kimi, and cursor are empirically verified for crewmate and secondmate launches; [README requirements](../README.md#requirements) own the set supported for the primary session.
A cursor secondmate or primary runs the tracked project-scope `.cursor/hooks.json` in its own home and must be launched with `--trust`, or no project hook loads; [`docs/supervision-protocols/cursor.md`](supervision-protocols/cursor.md) owns its supervision protocol.
Cursor delivery confirmation is verified on tmux and Herdr only.
muse is verified for crewmate and scout launches ONLY, and `fm-spawn.sh` refuses it for a secondmate, because muse ships no usable hook surface for a primary session's turn-end supervision; [`docs/verification/muse.md`](verification/muse.md) owns that evidence.
muse also needs a worker-reachable credential before spawning, and the portable fleet path is the `<config>/muse/auth.json` credential stored by `muse login`, because a caller-only `META_API_KEY` does not cross a long-lived backend daemon.
New harnesses get verified through a supervised trial task before joining the set.
The verified adapter evidence - each harness's busy-state source, interrupt and exit behavior, skill-invocation syntax, and per-harness quirks - lives in [`.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md).
The executable interrupt and exit mechanics live in [`bin/fm-control-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-control-lib.sh), and [`docs/agent-control.md`](agent-control.md) owns their lifecycle-control architecture.
Launch mechanics, including the verified command templates, live in [`bin/fm-spawn.sh`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh).
Pi-family launches adapt the regular-TUI safeguard to the installed CLI's capabilities; [`fm-spawn.sh --help`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh) owns the exact version-safe launch mechanics.
Enabled primary-session turn-end guard integrations are tracked as repo-level hook files and documented in [`docs/turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md).
Kimi remains outside the primary turn-end guard integrations; [`docs/turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md#compatibility-limits) owns its separate captain-approved crew wake hook.
Primary-session watcher wake protocols are rendered at session start by [`bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh`](../bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh) from [`docs/supervision-protocols/`](supervision-protocols/).
Claude's Stop `asyncRewake` hook owns tokenless re-arm cycles, Cursor's stop hook parks on the watcher, Grok uses background-notify cycles, Codex uses bounded foreground checkpoints, Pi and pi-signed use the same two tracked primary extensions, and OpenCode uses its TUI plugin.
`config/crew-harness` is a local, gitignored file containing one adapter name for crewmate and scout launches.
When pi-signed is selected, Firstmate preserves `FM_PI_HARNESS=pi-signed` and refuses the launch if the selected executable is unavailable rather than falling back to pi; [`fm-spawn.sh --help`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh) owns executable resolution and launch mechanics.
Plain Pi launches set `FM_PI_HARNESS=pi`, so a signed primary's environment cannot relabel a plain Pi worker.
When it is absent or contains `default`, crewmates mirror the firstmate's own harness.
`config/secondmate-harness` is a separate local, gitignored file containing the adapter the primary uses to launch secondmate agents, optionally followed by model and effort tokens on the same line.
The first non-empty, non-comment line is parsed as `<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]`.
A bare `<harness>` preserves the previous behavior: harness only, with no model or effort launch flag.
When the harness token is absent or `default`, secondmate launch falls back through `config/crew-harness` and then the primary's own harness, and no model or effort is read from that file.
`fm-harness.sh secondmate-model` and `fm-harness.sh secondmate-effort` expose only the optional tokens from `config/secondmate-harness`; `config/crew-harness` remains a bare adapter-name file.
Changing this pin affects the next secondmate spawn or control-plane relaunch; the relaunch profile rules are owned by [`docs/agent-control.md`](agent-control.md#transactional-relaunch).
An explicit harness argument to `fm-spawn.sh` still overrides either config file for that spawn only.
An explicit `--model` or `--effort` overrides the matching token from `config/secondmate-harness`; for a local route, an explicit harness or raw launch command starts with clean model and effort defaults unless those flags are also passed.
Remote secondmate routes accept verified harness adapters only and reject raw launch commands.
When `config/crew-dispatch.json` exists, crewmate and scout spawns require an explicit resolved harness instead of automatically falling back to `config/crew-harness`.
The inherited-local-material contract is owned by [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md); its harness-relevant consequence is that a secondmate's own crewmates use the primary's dispatch profiles and static harness value.
Those inherited values are defaults and rules only; `fm-spawn` still permits a consciously chosen explicit runtime outside the config.
`config/secondmate-harness` is not inherited because secondmates do not launch secondmates.
For grok, `fm-spawn.sh` installs one firstmate-owned global turn-end hook under `$GROK_HOME/hooks/`, or `~/.grok/hooks/` when `GROK_HOME` is unset, and drops a per-task `.fm-grok-turnend` pointer in the worktree, with teardown removing the task token and pointer.
For Kimi crews, `fm-spawn.sh` runs `fm-kimi-turnend-hook.sh install`, drops a per-task `.fm-kimi-turnend` pointer in the worktree, and records the matching private registry token for teardown.
Kimi continues to use the captain's normal Kimi home, including the existing config, skills, and memory; Firstmate does not create an isolated Kimi home.
The Kimi installer requires an existing regular non-symlink `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`, `python3` with `tomllib`, and `jq`; it validates but never serializes the captain's TOML and refuses before writing when the config is missing, malformed, or surprising or when either tool requirement is unavailable.
Its `remove` action excises only the marker-delimited Firstmate region and removes Firstmate's hook files.
For Pi and pi-signed secondmate launches, `fm-spawn.sh` starts the selected executable with `-e` pointed at the secondmate home's own tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` and `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts`, both already present from the secondmate home's git worktree.

## Crew dispatch profiles (config/crew-dispatch.json)

`config/crew-dispatch.json` is an optional local, gitignored file containing natural-language rules that firstmate reads before dispatching a crewmate or scout.
The shell scripts do not match those rules; firstmate chooses the best matching rule with judgment, resolves its profile object or array under the operating contract in `AGENTS.md` section 4 and `quota-array-dispatch`, and passes only concrete `--harness`, `--model`, and `--effort` flags to `fm-spawn.sh`.
When the file exists, `fm-spawn.sh` enforces that contract by refusing crewmate and scout spawns that lack an explicit harness (`--harness`, a positional adapter, or a raw launch command).
Batch spawns satisfy the same requirement with a shared `--harness`.
Secondmate spawns are exempt and still resolve through `config/secondmate-harness` and its optional model and effort tokens.
This section is the single owner of the canonical schema and its per-field semantics.
`AGENTS.md` section 4 owns the always-loaded dispatch intake boundary, and `quota-array-dispatch` owns the completion-aware profile-array selection procedure.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "when": "<natural-language condition describing a kind of task>",
      "use": [
        { "harness": "<adapter>", "model": "<optional model>", "effort": "<low|medium|high|xhigh|max, optional>" }
      ],
      "why": "<optional rationale that helps firstmate choose>"
    }
  ],
  "default": [
    { "harness": "<adapter>", "model": "<optional model>", "effort": "<optional effort>" }
  ]
}
```

Per rule, `when` and `use` are required.
Both `use` and the optional top-level `default` accept either one profile object or a non-empty array of profile objects.
The single-object form stays fully backward-compatible, and every profile needs `harness`.
Profile `model` and `effort` fields and rule `why` are optional.
An omitted model or effort means the selected harness uses its own default for that axis.
Every profile array is an implicit quota-aware choice resolved through `quota-array-dispatch`.
If no dispatch rule fits, firstmate resolves `default` through the same object-or-array path before falling back to `config/crew-harness`.
If a selected profile carries an effort value the chosen harness does not accept, `fm-spawn.sh` records the requested `effort=` in task meta for traceability but omits the launch flag, and bootstrap reports the invalid harness/effort pair as a `CREW_DISPATCH` diagnostic when it is visible in the file.
See [`docs/examples/crew-dispatch.json`](examples/crew-dispatch.json) for a starting point to copy into local `config/crew-dispatch.json`.
When the file exists, bootstrap validates it with `jq`.
Valid files stay silent by default; with `FM_BOOTSTRAP_VERBOSE_FACTS=1`, bootstrap emits `BOOTSTRAP_INFO: crew dispatch active config/crew-dispatch.json`, one `BOOTSTRAP_INFO:` fact per rule, and one fact for the optional default profile set.
Malformed JSON, an empty or malformed rule/default array, an unverified harness, or an effort value unsupported by that harness is reported as `CREW_DISPATCH: invalid config/crew-dispatch.json - ...`; missing `jq` is reported through the normal `MISSING: jq` install-consent flow.
While the file remains present, no crewmate or scout spawn may proceed without an explicit resolved harness; malformed configuration must be reported and corrected rather than selected around.
Secondmate homes inherit this file from the primary, so a secondmate's own crewmates apply the same dispatch profile behavior.

## Toolchain

On session start the first mate detects what its required toolchain is missing or too old and lists each problem with either an exact install command or manual instructions.
It installs automatically supported tools only after you say go; manual-only tools remain for you to install from the printed instructions.
Required tools come in two parts: a universal toolchain every home needs regardless of backend, and a per-backend delta that follows the runtime backend actually resolved for this home.
The universal toolchain is node, git, gh with GitHub auth via `gh auth login`, no-mistakes v1.31.2 or newer, compatible gh-axi, chrome-devtools-axi, compatible lavish-axi, compatible tasks-axi per "Backlog backend" above, and compatible quota-axi.
[`bin/fm-bootstrap.sh`](../bin/fm-bootstrap.sh) owns the axi-family floor policy and the gh-axi and lavish-axi floors, while [`bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh) and [`bin/fm-quota-axi-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-quota-axi-lib.sh) hold their own tools' floor constants.
This section is the single owner of that universal toolchain list; backend guides' prerequisites point here and add only their backend-specific tools.
In that list, no-mistakes runs the validation pipeline, gh-axi, chrome-devtools-axi, and lavish-axi cover GitHub, browser, and rich-review operations, and tasks-axi plus quota-axi back backlog mutations and quota-aware array dispatch.
The per-backend delta is required only for the backend resolved from `FM_BACKEND`, then `config/backend`, then runtime auto-detection, then default `tmux`, so a home is never told to install a tool an inactive backend or feature would need.
That delta is owned in code by `fm_backend_required_tools` in `bin/fm-backend.sh`: tmux plus treehouse for the default backend, or Herdr plus `jq` and treehouse for Herdr.
An unknown resolved backend emits `BACKEND_INVALID` and blocks dispatch instead of silently dropping its dependency delta or falling back to tmux.
A Herdr home is never told that tmux is missing, and both supported backends run the treehouse durable-lease upgrade check.
When `config/crew-dispatch.json` exists, bootstrap also requires `jq` for dispatch profile validation.
When Relay is opted in, bootstrap also requires `curl` and `jq` before arming the relay poll shim.
`tasks-axi` and `quota-axi` are required bootstrap tools in every profile, the same class as `lavish-axi`.
An absent or incompatible `tasks-axi` reports `MISSING: tasks-axi (install: npm install -g tasks-axi)`; when `config/backlog-backend` is not `manual` and compatible `tasks-axi` is on `PATH`, bootstrap stays silent and firstmate uses its verbs for routine backlog mutations, otherwise it hand-edits `data/backlog.md` until installation is approved and completed.
An absent or incompatible `gh-axi` reports `MISSING: gh-axi (install: npm install -g gh-axi && gh-axi setup hooks)`.
An absent or incompatible `lavish-axi` reports `MISSING: lavish-axi (install: npm install -g lavish-axi && lavish-axi setup hooks)`.
An absent or too-old `quota-axi` reports `MISSING: quota-axi (install: npm install -g quota-axi)`; firstmate cannot resolve a profile array without a compatible binary.
Bootstrap also reports a `TANGLE:` line when `FM_ROOT` is on a named non-default branch; follow the printed checkout remediation rather than treating it as an installable tool problem.
In a read-only session that did not get the fleet lock, the same line is advisory and omits the checkout command.
The locked session-start deferred network stage runs bootstrap's best-effort project clone refresh through `fm-fleet-sync.sh`.
It emits `FLEET_SYNC:` for skipped refreshes that may matter, recovered self-heals, and `STUCK:` alarms.
Normal completed runs keep local-only and no-origin skips silent.
If bootstrap kills a timed-out refresh, it replays any completed `fm-fleet-sync.sh` output before the aggregate timeout skip so no finished result is lost.
A killed refresh (or a teardown process kill) can leave an orphaned `.git/packed-refs.lock` in a clone, which makes the next refresh's fetch fail with Git's `Unable to create '...packed-refs.lock': File exists`.
On that signature only, `fm-fleet-sync.sh` retries the fetch with a bounded wait for the lock to self-clear, then removes the lock and retries once more only when it can prove the lock stale, exactly like the `fm-teardown.sh` `index.lock` recovery.
It never removes a live lock, leaves any other failure shape untouched, and prints every wait, retry, and removal to stderr plus a one-line `recovered:` summary to stdout on success so that this session-start relay still surfaces the recovery.
The same deferred network stage runs bootstrap's guarded secondmate sync for recorded live homes, then propagates declared inherited local material into each validated live home.
Local routes use direct guarded filesystem operations, while remote routes delegate sync and allowlisted transfer through their configured SSH host without probing any unconfigured fleet.
It emits `SECONDMATE_SYNC:` only when a home was skipped for an actionable sync reason, inheritance failed, or a divergent shared captain-preference copy was quarantined.
When a running home advances and its loaded instruction surface (`AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, or `.agents/skills/`) changed, bootstrap sends the re-read nudge itself through the stable `fm-<id>` selector and reports the exact completed send as `BOOTSTRAP_INFO:`.
If that send fails, bootstrap keeps an idempotent retry marker and emits `NUDGE_SECONDMATES:` with the failure reason.
The same bootstrap run emits `SECONDMATE_LIVENESS:` only when a registered secondmate is skipped or its relaunch fails; already-live and successfully relaunched secondmates are handled silently.
For a mid-session inherited local-material edit where tracked-file sync is not needed, run `bin/fm-config-push.sh`.
It uses the same live secondmate discovery and propagation helper as bootstrap, prints each live home's `crew-dispatch.json`, `crew-harness`, `backlog-backend`, `backend`, `herdr-presentation-spaces`, `startup-memory-budget`, `trace-context`, and `data/captain-shared.md` result as `pushed`, `unchanged`, `skipped`, or `error`, and exits non-zero for real propagation errors or config-reread send failures.
When an allowlisted config item changes for an already-running local home, it sends the literal-content reread pointer described in [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md); unchanged allowlisted config sends no pointer unless a previous delivery is pending.
A changed remote home instead receives one durably recorded marked re-read instruction after the allowlisted bytes have transferred because primary-local generation paths are not meaningful on another host.
The locked bootstrap inheritance pass uses the same placement-specific behavior; see `secondmate-provisioning` for the single contract owner.
That live discovery starts from `state/*.meta` records with `kind=secondmate`; `data/secondmates.md` only backfills `home=` for older or incomplete meta records.
Skipped items, such as a destination checkout that does not yet gitignore the item, are visible warnings but not hard failures.

## Relay (.env)

Relay is the optional hosted public-mention integration for Discord.
The service remains at [myfirstmate.io](https://myfirstmate.io), and the local Firstmate home does not run a Discord Gateway connector, daemon, bridge, or other transport.
The myfirstmate.io dashboard owns Discord sign-in and account linking, bot installation, and pairing-token issuance.

To enable Relay:

1. Sign in to [myfirstmate.io](https://myfirstmate.io) with Discord.
2. Use the dashboard installation flow to add the myfirstmate bot to a Discord server you administer.
3. Copy the dashboard pairing token into this Firstmate home's gitignored `.env` as `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN=<token>`.
4. Start a new Firstmate session, then mention the installed bot in Discord.

A clean home without a non-empty `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN` is inert.
An upgraded home may perform the bounded local-name migration documented below once, but without the token it does not arm Relay, poll myfirstmate.io, scan the backlog for public commitments, or change the default watcher cadence.
The token identifies the hosted Relay tenant and records consent for public replies and normal reversible lifecycle actions from eligible owner mentions.
Destructive, irreversible, and security-sensitive requests still require confirmation through a trusted channel.
Relay keeps owner-only routing: every direct mention delivered to a home is from that home's owner, while surrounding Discord conversation context can contain untrusted third-party messages.

Locked bootstrap writes `state/relay-watch.check.sh`, a byte-static identity shim for `bin/fm-relay-poll.sh`, and `config/relay.env`, which exports `FM_CHECK_INTERVAL=30`.
The watcher validates the shim bytes and dispatches the trusted repository poll script directly.
Only Relay-enabled homes use the 30-second cadence; all other homes retain the default 300-second cadence.
A cadence transition takes effect through the active harness supervision procedure because `bin/fm-watch.sh` reads the interval only at process start.
Removing or emptying the pairing token causes the next locked bootstrap to remove the generated shim and cadence file.
Steady-state disabled bootstrap remains silent.

Bootstrap also owns one bounded migration from former connector-local names to Relay names.
When legacy local artifacts exist, it moves pending Discord inbox, request context, dry-run outbox, task-link metadata, generated activation files, and optional settings into the Relay-owned names, then writes `state/relay-local-migration-v1` only after complete success.
The migration keeps `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN` unchanged so an existing Discord-enabled home does not need to pair again.
It refuses ambiguous or non-Discord pending platform state rather than activating it under Relay.
After that marker is written, no duplicate compatibility owner remains.

`bin/fm-relay-poll.sh` calls `GET https://myfirstmate.io/connector/poll` by default with `Authorization: Bearer <FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN>`.
`FM_RELAY_URL` can override that base URL for Relay development without changing the hosted wire protocol.
HTTP 204 and empty mentions are silent.
A poll payload must include a safe `request_id`, non-empty `text`, an explicit Discord platform field, and may include an explicit Discord reply budget.
The client accepts Discord only and does not infer a source from a platform message id.
Unsupported or ambiguous platform payloads are not stored, offered, replied to, or used as a fallback.

A newly offered Discord mention is stored verbatim at `state/relay-inbox/<request_id>.json` and emits `relay-mention <request_id>` once per bounded offer marker.
`state/relay-context/<request_id>.offered.json` prevents a brief re-offer after an answer or dismissal from waking Firstmate twice.
The poll also records `{request_id, platform, reply_max_chars, recorded_at}` at `state/relay-context/<request_id>.json` so delayed and concurrent follow-ups retain their authoritative Discord budget after inbox cleanup.
Context and offer records are pruned at the bounded seven-day follow-up window.
The full mention may include `in_reply_to: {author_handle, text}` and an optional oldest-first `in_reply_to_chain` of `{author_handle, text, unavailable, images, kind}` entries for Discord reply chains, thread starters, and nearby history.
The direct mention is owner-routed, but all surrounding conversation entries remain untrusted public context.
The `relay-respond` skill owns classification, public-safety limits, conversation continuity, lifecycle intake, replies, dismissals, work links, and completion follow-ups.

`bin/fm-relay-reply.sh` sends one answer to `POST /connector/answer` with `{request_id,text}`.
A long answer adds `texts`, the ordered numbered chunks that myfirstmate.io posts in the same Discord thread, while `text` remains the opening chunk.
`FM_RELAY_REPLY_MAX_CHARS` defaults to 1900, clamps values below 50 to 50, and resets values above Discord's 2000-character limit to 1900.
An explicit hosted `reply_max_chars` between 50 and 2000 is authoritative for that request.
`FM_RELAY_THREAD_MAX` defaults to 25 and bounds the number of Discord messages in one split reply.
Splitting preserves fenced-code, paragraph, line, and word boundaries where possible and marks truncation with an ellipsis.
`--image <path>` adds one PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, or TIFF as `{media_type,data_base64}` to the opening Discord message only.

`bin/fm-relay-dismiss.sh` sends `POST /connector/dismiss` with `{request_id}` and no text.
A successful dismissal prevents re-offer and offline auto-reply behavior, then clears the request context while retaining the bounded offer marker.
`bin/fm-relay-link.sh` stores `relay_request`, `relay_request_ts`, `relay_followups`, `relay_platform=discord`, and `relay_reply_max_chars` in task metadata for work that continues after the acknowledgement.
A successor task uses paired `--carry-count <n> --carry-ts <epoch> --carry-platform discord --carry-max <n>` arguments to preserve the consumed count, original window, and Discord budget.

`bin/fm-relay-followup.sh` posts through `POST /connector/followup` up to three times within seven days.
A successful non-final follow-up increments `relay_followups`; `--final`, the cap, expiry, or an exhausted hosted binding clears the task link.
A failed transport leaves the link for retry.
A follow-up with no authoritative Discord platform or explicit budget is held without posting until request-context lookup can recover both values from myfirstmate.io.
`FM_RELAY_FOLLOWUP_MAX_AGE_SECS` defaults to 604800 and `FM_RELAY_FOLLOWUP_MAX_COUNT` defaults to 3.

Set `FM_RELAY_DRY_RUN` to preview replies and dismissals without posting.
Truthy means anything except unset, empty, `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`, and an environment value wins over `.env`.
Preview records live under `state/relay-outbox/<request_id>.json` and replace attached image bytes with `{media_type, bytes, source_path}` metadata.
`FM_RELAY_ENV_FILE` can point direct client calls at another `.env`-style file, but bootstrap activation still reads the Firstmate home's `.env`.

### Promised public replies (state/public-followup)

A promised final reply is a typed `kind=public-followup` obligation owned by `tasks-axi public-followup`, while full request context remains in `state/relay-context/`.
`bin/fm-public-followup.sh` registers the commitment, reconciles typed terminal work results, posts the final Discord reply through `bin/fm-relay-reply.sh --followup`, validates its receipt, and clears the bound task link.
Only the home holding the pairing token and opaque thread binding can post the reply.
Remote work reports typed terminal results through `bin/fm-public-followup-emit.sh` and never receives Discord credentials or thread context.
Unreconciled terminal results ride the existing Relay poll, and session start lists any still-open commitment from disk.
A home without the pairing token stops before any public-followup state creation, tasks-axi call, or backlog scan.
`bin/fm-teardown.sh` refuses cleanup while the exact work still owes a public reply unless explicit discard authority is carried by `--force`.
`FM_PF_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECS` defaults to 900 for retryable delivery errors.
See [verification/public-followup.md](verification/public-followup.md) for current maintainer evidence.

## Process-to-event sources (state/procevent)

A long-polling external process is registered as a *source* through its adapter, whose header and `--help` own the commands and flags.
`bin/fm-procevent.sh` owns the generic contract; `bin/fm-procevent-lavish.sh` is the first adapter and wraps only the currently published `lavish-axi poll` interface.

The `when` adapter (`bin/fm-procevent-when.sh`) turns this channel into a condition->action primitive: it registers a deterministic condition and a deterministic action once, its blocking child polls the condition without waking firstmate, and a stable true fires the action at most once before one terminal outcome is durably captured and published as a wake that remains eligible for re-announcement until handled.
The (condition, action) spec is stored privately under `state/when/` and hash-bound by a trust record the same way `bin/fm-check-register.sh` binds a custom check, while the spec separately binds the resolved action executable's bytes; a mutated or unregistered spec or a changed action executable is refused before the action runs.
Every failure path - a mutated spec or action executable, a condition error past its budget, an expired deadline, a failed action, or an earlier fire whose outcome was never captured - produces a terminal captured outcome that wakes firstmate rather than a silent retry, and a durable single-fire marker claimed before the action makes restarts and re-polls unable to fire it twice.
The adapter automates only the exact deterministic subset: anything needing judgment, and anything destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive, keeps the ordinary check-fires-then-firstmate-decides flow, and the adapter's header and `--help` own its commands, flags, and outcome document.

This section is the single owner of the runner's operating contract.
Registration writes one private record under `state/procevent/`, and a completed result plus its immutable adapter identity are captured under `state/procevent-inbox/` before any announcement or event can reference it.
By default, results are published as ordinary `check` wakes carrying the source id and committed result sequence through the existing durable wake queue, so the runner adds no second notification control plane.
The self-announcing adapter exception and its fail-safe ordering are defined below.
The watcher delivers a queued result on its ordinary cycle by reporting it as an actionable `check` wake, so a default or fallback publication reaches firstmate through the same rewake path every other wake uses and never waits for a manual drain.
A queued `check` delivery is reported at most once per captured source and sequence while any records for that key remain queued.
A durable handled acknowledgement stops future source re-announcement, while a record already queued remains under the durable queue's authority until the ordinary drain's sequence-bound post-handling acknowledgement consumes it.

Discovery is never a timer.
Each registered source has its own child process blocking on that source, and the watcher's per-cycle `reconcile` republishes every captured result with no durable handled acknowledgement yet - regardless of any earlier publication - restarts a source whose owner is gone, and stops this home's runner when reconciliation runs after its registration disappeared unexpectedly.
In supported steady state, a home with no registered source runs nothing, generates no state, and keeps its ordinary cadence.

Whether a captured result ends its source is adapter knowledge, never the runner's.
After capture - and after initial `check` publication for the default ordering - the runner calls `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh terminal <result-file>` and retires the registration on exit 0 alone, dropping only the exact registration generation captured by its claim and releasing that claim only after removal succeeds under one source boundary; a missing command, an error, or any other exit keeps the source armed, so an adapter with no notion of ending needs no change.
A failed terminal removal stays durably terminal and is completed by ordinary reconciliation without restarting its poll, while a concurrently replaced registration survives and becomes independently runnable after the old claim releases.
A source that has ended therefore captures at most one terminal result, is never restarted, and leaves no recurring poll work, while explicit `retire` stays the supported and idempotent path afterwards.
For Lavish that verdict covers an ended session, a missing session, and the final feedback of a `Send & End` review, which the published poll marks with `session_ended` before it returns only empty ended sessions.

Applying a captured result is adapter knowledge too, and some results carry no judgement at all: they must simply be applied idempotently to this home's own durable state.
Leaving that to a handler means it can silently not happen, so immediately after the terminal check above the runner calls `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh autohandle <source-id> <sequence> <result-file>` and lets the adapter apply and acknowledge its own result.
That call runs strictly after terminal retirement, because a handling adapter re-arms its own next source and retiring afterwards would drop that fresh registration and leave the source silently dead.
Exit 0 means the adapter fully applied and acknowledged the result; a missing command, an error, or any other exit is not a capture failure but leaves the result unacknowledged and therefore still eligible for re-announcement, so a handler receives it exactly as before and an adapter with no such command needs no change.
Announcement ordering is adapter-declared through `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh self-announcing`: an adapter that answers exit 0 declares that every result its autohandle fully applies is announced through a durable downstream channel of its own, so the runner applies first and publishes a `check` wake only for what remains unhandled afterwards; every other adapter keeps the strict publish-before-apply order, and its autohandle runs only when this capture's own wake was successfully appended to the durable queue.
The remote-secondmate reply adapter declares itself self-announcing: a captured reply reaches its local status mirror and settles its correlated pending-reply expectation without any handler step, the mirrored status bytes are the single wake for one remote note through the same signal classification a local secondmate's append gets, a byte-identical replayed capture adds no bytes and stays quiet, and only a capture the adapter could not fully apply is published as a `check` wake, whose adapter handling remains idempotent.

Ownership is machine-wide per canonical source, because separate homes can share one underlying source store.
Claims live under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/firstmate/procevent-claims` (override with `FM_PROCEVENT_CLAIM_ROOT`).
Each claim binds its home and runner PID to a process identity, unique claim generation, and exact registration-file generation.
Registration, acquisition, replacement, retirement, and generation-bound release are serialized at one machine-wide boundary per source.
A live identity-matched owner is never displaced, and release removes only the exact generation the caller acquired.
Retirement and orphan reconciliation signal a runner process group only while its recorded process identity still matches, or when the recorded leader is gone and only its own owned group survives.
A runner leads its own process group, so a claim counts as reclaimable only when that whole generation is gone: a crashed leader whose group still has members is not stale, and reconcile stops that surviving group and releases its generation before starting any replacement.
If identity cannot be established for a live PID, or a surviving owned group cannot be proved stopped, the operation preserves the registration and claim for safe retry rather than adding a second owner.
A live PID whose identity no longer matches is a reused PID, so it is treated as stale and its process group is never signalled.

Supported secondmate retirement preflights each target home's bounded `sweep-home` command before destructive teardown, snapshots its registrations outside the target, then runs the sweep at that home's final deletion or return boundary.
If deletion or return fails, teardown restores those registrations and reconciles them before returning the refusal.
If restoration or rearming also fails, teardown returns a distinct status and reports the retained registration backup path for manual recovery instead of hiding the retired waits.
The sweep retires local registrations and machine-wide claims physically owned by that home through the same identity-checked, generation-bound retirement path, and leaves foreign-home claims untouched.
Teardown refuses with the home, lease, routing evidence, registrations, claims, and runners retained when identity is uncertain, ownership is unreadable or unreleased, or relevant state exists without a sweep-capable child script.
Raw manual deletion of a Firstmate home is unsupported because it can orphan a blocking child.
To recover, restore that home's tracked `bin/fm-procevent.sh`, run `FM_HOME=<home> <home>/bin/fm-procevent.sh sweep-home`, then rerun the supported teardown.

`FM_PROCEVENT_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` (default 1048576) bounds a single captured result while the source runs; oversized output is drained but truncated with a stderr notice rather than staged or published whole or dropped.

The runner proves exactly one durability boundary: output that reached the runner is stored at mode `0600` before any event referencing it is published, and a captured result with no durable handled acknowledgement remains eligible for bounded re-announcement across any number of drains and restarts, not only the crash window right after capture.
`bin/fm-procevent.sh handled <source-id> <sequence>` is the only thing that stops re-announcement: a generation-keyed, private, path-safe, durable, and idempotent acknowledgement that atomically checks and deduplicates by the exact source and sequence, so a paired effect gated on its first-time-vs-repeat report is never authorized twice.
Default and fallback `check` publication is still best-effort, so the same source and sequence can repeat even before any restart; handlers deduplicate that identity rather than assuming a wake is unique.
The runner proves nothing about the source side, and the handled acknowledgement proves nothing about a paired external effect performed before it: a crash between that effect and the acknowledgement call can still repeat the effect on replay, so this is never a generic exactly-once guarantee.
The published `lavish-axi poll` clears feedback destructively before returning it, so a result lost between that clearing and the runner reading process output is unrecoverable.
Never describe this path as at-least-once, no-loss, or lossless.
`docs/verification/process-event-sources.md` holds the measurements and `.agents/skills/process-event-sources/SKILL.md` owns the handling procedure.

```

`fm-teardown.sh` retries only Git's `Unable to create '...index.lock': File exists` return failure up to `FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRIES` times.
`FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRIES` accepts a nonnegative integer, and an unset, blank, or invalid value uses the default of 3.
`FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` accepts nonnegative whole or fractional seconds between attempts.
When it is unset or blank, `FM_STALE_WORKTREE_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` remains a compatible fallback, and a blank fallback uses the 1-second default.
An invalid nonblank wait falls back to 1 second rather than interrupting teardown.
Teardown never removes a lock during the retry window, and after that window it attempts stale-lock cleanup only for a still-present lock that passes the configured age and live-holder checks.

`fm-fleet-sync.sh` applies the same shape to an orphaned `.git/packed-refs.lock`: it retries only Git's `Unable to create '...packed-refs.lock': File exists` fetch failure up to `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_RETRIES` times (nonnegative integer; unset, blank, or invalid uses the default of 3), waiting `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` seconds (nonnegative whole or fractional; invalid falls back to 1 second) before each.
Only after those retries exhaust does it remove the lock, and only when it is provably stale - still present, mtime age at least `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_AGE_SECS` (default 30), and no `lsof` holder of the lock file or of the clone worktree itself (a live `git` keeps that as its cwd even in the window after it closes the lock and before it exits).
A live lock, a missing `lsof`, any failed check, or any other fetch failure keeps today's behavior.
Every wait, retry, and removal is printed to stderr, and a successful recovery also prints one `recovered:` summary line to stdout so a session-start refresh - which discards fleet-sync stderr and relays only stdout - still surfaces it.
The shared staleness proof lives in `bin/fm-lock-lib.sh`, which both `fm-teardown.sh` and `fm-fleet-sync.sh` use.
